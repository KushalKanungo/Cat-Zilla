Choose the best answer to each question.</b>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Published in 2000 \u201cBowling Alone\u201d, the landmark study by Robert Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard, offered a sweeping survey of what ailed American society by detailing a steady erosion in the amount of social interaction among people who are not family, close </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">friends</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> or work colleagues\u2014a concept called \u201csocial capital\u201d. The withdrawal of Americans from bowling leagues, religious life and volunteering was a symptom of anomie, Mr Putnam argued\u2026 Social scientists have argued about the supposed importance of social capital in the intervening decades. A comprehensive set of studies by a team of economists, just published in </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Nature</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">,</span> <span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">strikes a blow in favour of those who have championed the importance of social capital\u2026</span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Fittingly for the new age of social science, the data come from Faceboo</span>k. <span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The large research team worked with the social-media giant\u2019s proprietary data on 72.2m young American adults and the 21bn friendships they had formed on the site. The shape of every person\u2019s network of friends could be converted into a few simple, empirical scores of social </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">capital</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">. Data on the hometowns, workplaces and educational histories of Facebook users allowed the researchers to estimate how social capital varied between places in a much finer-grained way than previously possible. And, most important, they were able to correlate these neighbourhood-level measures of social capital with important outcomes like graduating successfully from high school and having </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">upward social mobility</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">.</span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">One measure seemed especially important. What the researchers called \u201ceconomic connectedness\u201d\u2014the extent of friendships across social classes\u2014was strongly associated with increased rates of high-school completion, reduced rates of teenage pregnancy and increased income for those born poorer. Moving from a place where friendships across social strata are relatively uncommon (a one-in-four chance of a friendship between someone in the bottom half of the class distribution and someone in the top) to one where it was relatively standard (a one-in-two chance) translated into an 8.2% increase in future earnings, the researchers found.</span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">This corroborates findings in other recent large-scale examinations: places in America that are more segregated by race or income seem to give poor kids less of a chance\u2026 The most important institutions for encouraging these friendships seem to be colleges and universities\u2026 Past research has also found long-term benefits for poor kids who attend integrated schools or who do not live in neighbourhoods where poverty is extremely concentrated. Divine intervention helps, too. The researchers also found that intra-class friendships were most easily struck up in religious settings.</span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Other classical definitions of social capital such as the extent of civic engagement and the cohesiveness of bonds within social classes did not appear to be correlated with improved life outcomes</span>. <span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Verifying [the theory of social capital] has always been difficult. And even though this study is studded with quantitative measures derived from big data, its findings remain largely based on associations and correlations. It is hard to think of a way to experimentally vary a person\u2019s degree of social capital\u2014even leaving aside the ethical problems with doing it. Whatever uncertainty remains, the imperative for integration seems to have become stronger still.</span>",

It\u2019s a question that\u2019s just starting to attract more attention. Now, two new studies have proposed theories on how negative consequences of fire might have shaped human evolution and development. In the first, scientists identified a genetic mutation in modern humans that allows certain toxins, including those found in smoke, to be metabolized at a safe rate. The same genetic sequence was not found in other primates, including ancient hominins such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. The researchers believe the mutation was selected for in response to breathing in smoke toxins, which can increase the risk of respiratory infections, suppress the immune </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">system</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> and disrupt the reproductive system.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">It\u2019s possible that having this mutation gave modern humans an evolutionary edge over Neanderthals, though it\u2019s speculation at this point. But if the speculation is correct, the mutation may have been one </span>way that modern humans were inured against some adverse effects from fire, while other species were not. Thomas Henle, a chemistry professor at Dresden University of Technology in Germany, has wondered whether humans also have unique genetic mutations to better handle, or even take advantage of, <span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">byproducts</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> of fire in food.

The second study, published last week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that with fire\u2019s advantageous effects for human societies also came profound new damage. It offers conjecture that the early use of fire might have helped spread tuberculosis by bringing people into close contact, damaging their </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">lungs</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> and causing them to cough.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">With mathematical </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">modeling</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">, Rebecca Chisholm and Mark Tanaka, biologists at the University of New South Wales in Australia, simulated how ancient soil bacteria might have evolved to become infectious tuberculosis agents. Without fire, the probability was low. But when the researchers added fire to their model, the likelihood that tuberculosis would emerge jumped by several degrees of magnitude.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">It is thought that tuberculosis has killed more than a billion people, possibly accounting for more deaths than wars and famines combined\u2026 Many experts believe tuberculosis arose at least 70,000 years ago. By then, humans were most certainly controlling fire. She and </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Dr.</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> Tanaka believe that fire might have helped spread other airborne diseases, not just tuberculosis. \u201cFire, as a technological advantage, has been a double-edged sword,\u201d </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Dr.</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> Tanaka said.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Negative cultural consequences came with fire, too \u2014 and continue to leave an imprint. Anthropologists have speculated that inhaling smoke led to the discovery of smoking. Humans have long used fire to modify their environment and burn carbon, practices that now have us in the throes of climate change. Fire is even tied to the rise of patriarchy \u2014 by allowing men to go out hunting while women stayed behind to cook by the fire, it spawned gender norms that still exist today\u2026</span>",

    "Explanation": "The main argument of the passage is that the harmful effects of fire have shaped human evolution and development. This is based on the premise that a particular genetic mutation is present in humans and not in Neanderthals \u2013 whatever their relation may be, the implication is that Neanderthals possibly could not survive because of its lack, and humans succeeded because of it. For this conclusion to be true, it must be assumed that both used fire. To cast the most serious doubt on this argument, we need to find the statement that contradicts this idea. Therefore, option 4, which suggests that Neanderthals used fire and still succeeded (in evolution), would cast the most serious doubt on the main argument of the passage. If Neanderthals were successful in using fire, it would imply that the harmful effects of fire did not have a significant impact on their evolution. While it still acknowledges that humans might have succeeded because of the mutation, the option makes the comparison irrelevant and destroys the argument. The other options do not necessarily contradict the main argument of the passage. Options 1, 2, and 3 are all consistent with the idea that humans and other hominids experienced different evolutionary paths.\r<br />\r<br /><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Option 1. The fact that tuberculosis and other airborne diseases were common among Neanderthals and Denisovans does not negate the possibility that fire had consequences on human evolution and development.</span>\r<br /><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Option 2. Even if Neanderthals and humans had different evolutionary lineages, it is still possible that the harmful effects of fire had an impact on human evolution and development.</span>\r<br /><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Option 3. It does not directly address the central claim about the impact of fire on human evolution and development.</span>\r<br /><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Hence, [4].</span>",

It\u2019s a question that\u2019s just starting to attract more attention. Now, two new studies have proposed theories on how negative consequences of fire might have shaped human evolution and development. In the first, scientists identified a genetic mutation in modern humans that allows certain toxins, including those found in smoke, to be metabolized at a safe rate. The same genetic sequence was not found in other primates, including ancient hominins such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. The researchers believe the mutation was selected for in response to breathing in smoke toxins, which can increase the risk of respiratory infections, suppress the immune </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">system</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> and disrupt the reproductive system.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">It\u2019s possible that having this mutation gave modern humans an evolutionary edge over Neanderthals, though it\u2019s speculation at this point. But if the speculation is correct, the mutation may have been one </span>way that modern humans were inured against some adverse effects from fire, while other species were not. Thomas Henle, a chemistry professor at Dresden University of Technology in Germany, has wondered whether humans also have unique genetic mutations to better handle, or even take advantage of, <span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">byproducts</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> of fire in food. In 2011, his research group showed that the brown molecules that come from roasting coffee can inhibit enzymes produced by </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">tumor</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> cells, which might explain why coffee drinkers may be at lower risk for certain cancers\u2026</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Humans may not have been able to adjust to </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">all of</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> the dangers of fire. The second study, published last week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that with fire\u2019s advantageous effects for human societies also came profound new damage. It offers conjecture that the early use of fire might have helped spread tuberculosis by bringing people into close contact, damaging their </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">lungs</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> and causing them to cough.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">With mathematical </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">modeling</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">, Rebecca Chisholm and Mark Tanaka, biologists at the University of New South Wales in Australia, simulated how ancient soil bacteria might have evolved to become infectious tuberculosis agents. Without fire, the probability was low. But when the researchers added fire to their model, the likelihood that tuberculosis would emerge jumped by several degrees of magnitude.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">It is thought that tuberculosis has killed more than a billion people, possibly accounting for more deaths than wars and famines combined\u2026 Many experts believe tuberculosis arose at least 70,000 years ago. By then, humans were most certainly controlling fire. She and </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Dr.</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> Tanaka believe that fire might have helped spread other airborne diseases, not just tuberculosis. \u201cFire, as a technological advantage, has been a double-edged sword,\u201d </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Dr.</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\"> Tanaka said.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;background-color: white;\">Negative cultural consequences came with fire, too \u2014 and continue to leave an imprint. Anthropologists have speculated that inhaling smoke led to the discovery of smoking. Humans have long used fire to modify their environment and burn carbon, practices that now have us in the throes of climate change. Fire is even tied to the rise of patriarchy \u2014 by allowing men to go out hunting while women stayed behind to cook by the fire, it spawned gender norms that still exist today\u2026</span>",

    "Explanation": "</span>\tBased on the passage, the mathematical model described in paragraph 4 is focused on the impact of fire on the emergence of tuberculosis. Therefore, the option that would pose the most serious challenge to the prediction of the model would be one that undermines the importance of fire in the emergence of tuberculosis.\r<br /><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Option 2 suggests that tuberculosis had emerged before the evolution of modern humans, and it infected a variety of species through soil or water. This option challenges the prediction of the model because it suggests that tuberculosis was already widespread before the introduction of fire by humans. If this option were true, it would imply that the emergence of tuberculosis was not closely linked to the use of fire by humans, (though not fire itself) and thus it would pose a serious challenge to the model's prediction.</span>\r<br />Option 1. While this may be true, it is not directly related to the prediction of the mathematical model in paragraph 4. The model is focused on the impact of fire on the emergence of tuberculosis, and changes in genetic makeup over time do not challenge that prediction.\r<br /><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Option 3. It does not challenge the prediction of the mathematical model.

Indeed, </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">a report last year</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> from Gartner, a research and consulting firm, found that roughly half of Millennial shoppers said that they were indifferent to whether a product is brand-name or private-label, and that they would buy more private-label goods if the market provided them.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Retailers like private-label products too\u2014they often have </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">higher profit margins for stores</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> than brand-name goods do. The national grocery chain Kroger has taken a particular liking to them. According to </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">an article from Reuters earlier this year</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">, Kroger has a team of 400 employees who develop its private-label products, poring over sales data to pounce on new trends.

Each Kroger store, on average, has more than 15,000 house-brand products, </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">and,</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> the sales of these products accounted for about 27 percent of the chain\u2019s grocery sales last year\u2026</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">Private-label products currently account for much larger shares of sales for brick-and-mortar stores than they do for online retailers. According to the market-research firm Nielsen, $17 out of every $100 spent in American brick-and-mortar stores goes to private-label brands, while online, private-label products make up only 3 percent of sales of packaged goods\u2026</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">A spokesperson for Amazon told me that its private-label products \u201conly account for about 1 percent of our total retail sales.\u201d The company does sell a range of products under Amazon-owned brands, but lately it has been focusing on assembling an arsenal of goods that are made by other companies but </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">can\u2019t be purchased anywhere except on Amazon</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">. Forming exclusive brand partnerships allows Amazon to add unique products and plug assortment gaps in high-demand categories without having to spend the resources to develop, manufacture and sell them\u2026</span><br><br><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">The market-research firm IRI has found that the prices of private-label products are on average 20 percent lower than those of brand-name products, but there\u2019s apparently such a thing as too good of a deal. Christopher Durham, the private-label consultant, told me a story about working with a retailer on a pack of private-label batteries. Their price was about 60 percent cheaper than what the brand-name version was selling for, but even though Durham said they were of comparable quality, sales were \u201cvery, very slow on them.\u201d He and his team experimented with different </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">prices, and</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\"> arrived at a somewhat amazing conclusion: \u201cWe could move the price up to about 25 percent less than the national brand, and the [sales] volume went up about seven times. Which is crazy, right? But [the customer was thinking], </span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">These are so cheap\u2014I don</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">\u2019</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">t trust them</span><span style=\"font-family: ;color: #000000;\">.\u201d \u2026</span>",

The passage does not provide any information or imply that private-label products are always of the same quality as brand-name products and should be priced accordingly to maintain sales. Instead, it suggests that customers may associate lower prices with lower quality, which may lead to suspicion and slow sales. Companies may need to find a balance between offering a good deal and setting a price that customers will trust, and setting a price that is too low may hurt sales of a product, even if it is of comparable quality to a higher-priced competitor.\r<br /><span style=\"font-family: ;\">Hence, [3].</span>",

A tranche of research over the past few years, amid the global coronavirus pandemic, a rise in armed conflicts, and increased economic woes, has offered a glimpse into what leaves us restless at night and the ways social media and our phones exacerbate feelings of helplessness. Spawning from a sense of inadequacy about one&rsquo;s appearance or a perceived lack of achievements, anyone scrolling their phones for extended periods and misusing social media faces an elevated risk of depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-harm, and suicide. But when at least one in five get their news through social media, it seems a near impossibility to disassociate from our digital avatars and the mobile computers we cart with us everywhere.

However, we know that many children who enter school are behind on their language skills, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some argue that formal teaching allows these children to access the support and skills that others may pick up informally at home. This line of thinking is espoused by many educational authorities, who say that teaching reading early to those behind on their spoken language is \"the only effective route to closing this [language ability] gap\".\u00a0 Others favour the opposite approach, of immersing children in an environment where they can enjoy and develop their language comprehension, which is after all central to reading success.</span>",

Pipeline-1 passes through checkpoint </span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\">C1</span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"> and pipeline-2 passes through checkpoint C2. Any pipeline carries petroleum products in integral multiples of 10000 gallons. Total time taken to carry 10000 gallons of petroleum products from A to C1 and C2 to B is the same, which is 10 hours. If an additional volume of output is sent through these two portions of the pipeline, each additional 10000 gallons increases the total transportation time by 30 minutes and 25 minutes from A to C1 and C2 to B respectively. For example, the time taken to carry 20000 gallons of petroleum from A to C1 is 10 hours and 30 minutes and so on.

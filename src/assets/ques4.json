Though the territorial arrangements of 1919 to 1921 still left a number of additional nations in East Central Europe stateless and created problems of aggrieved minorities allocated to states toward which they felt little or no affinity, conditions that induced revisionist apologists for the territorial losers of World War I to charge that the territorial arrangements were merely a cynical and unprincipled victors\u2019 fiat, for all their admitted flaws, they still freed three times as many people from nationally alien rule as they subjected to such rule.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The real political weakness of the interwar effort to implement the principle of national self-determination in East Central Europe lay not in its alleged hypocrisy, but in the impossibility of reconciling it with three other important aims of the peacemakers of 1919 to 1921: the permanent diminution of German power, the permanent containment of Russian power, and the permanent restoration of international order in Europe.

In absolute terms, Germany\u2019s industrial and transportation resources had been left largely intact because World War I had not been fought on its territory.

As a result, the geopolitical map of interwar East Central Europe was not in line with the distribution of power in the region. Germany and Russia were revisionist threats to the territorial and social settlements in the region, with Germany remaining a major power despite its defeat in World War I. The presence of these newly independent states proved to be an asset for Germany, as they served as a buffer against the spread of the Bolshevik Revolution, tempted Soviet Russia to collaborate with Germany, and ultimately frustrated efforts at cooperation between the Soviet Union and the West to halt Nazi Germany in the late 1930s.<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"\">Option 1.

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">At the close of World War I, the four defeated empires that had dominated and ruled East Central Europe\u2014the German, Habsburg, Ottoman, and Russian empires\u2014were replaced by a dozen new or restored or enlarged would-be nation-states, all of which based their asserted legitimation on the then reigning politico-moral principle of national self-determination. Though the territorial arrangements of 1919 to 1921 still left a number of additional nations in East Central Europe stateless and created problems of aggrieved minorities allocated to states toward which they felt little or no affinity, conditions that induced revisionist apologists for the territorial losers of World War I to charge that the territorial arrangements were merely a cynical and unprincipled victors\u2019 fiat, for all their admitted flaws, they still freed three times as many people from nationally alien rule as they subjected to such rule.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The real political weakness of the interwar effort to implement the principle of national self-determination in East Central Europe lay not in its alleged hypocrisy, but in the impossibility of reconciling it with three other important aims of the peacemakers of 1919 to 1921: the permanent diminution of German power, the permanent containment of Russian power, and the permanent restoration of international order in Europe. In other words, the geopolitical map of interwar East Central Europe, with its plethora of new, restored, and enlarged so-called<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">nation-states, was not congruent with the real distribution of power in Europe.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Germany and Soviet Russia embodied the two basic revisionist threats to the territorial and social settlements of the interwar years\u2026 The defeat of Germany in 1918 was deceptive. Neither in absolute nor in relative terms had Germany been weakened to anything like the extent that was often assumed in the 1920s. In absolute terms, Germany\u2019s industrial and transportation resources had been left largely intact because World War I had not been fought on its territory. In relative terms, a territorial settlement predicated on the national principle, such as that popular in 1919 to 1921, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">ipso facto<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> left Germany as Europe\u2019s second largest country after Russia. Relative to East Central Europe, Germany gained through the replacement of the Habsburg Empire, which for all its infirmities had still been a major power\u2026 Germany\u2019s geographical position in the <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">center<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of the continent was only enhanced by these developments.<\/span>\r<br>\r<br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The very existence of the newly independent but highly vulnerable states of East Central Europe, endorsed by the victorious Western Allies, proved on balance a political and diplomatic asset to <\/span>Germany. It (1) initially buffered Germany against a <span style=\"color: #000000;\">spillover<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of the Bolshevik Revolution, (2) then tempted Soviet Russia to collaborate with Germany throughout the 1920s and in the partition of this area in 1939 and 1940, and (3) ultimately frustrated efforts at Soviet\u2013Western cooperation to halt Nazi Germany in the late 1930s, as the West was then inhibited by its commitments to the successor states from paying the Soviet Union\u2019s price for such cooperation\u2014the sacrifice of East Central Europe\u2019s effective independence to Soviet hegemony\u2026<\/span>",

Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">For thousands of years, there have always been three types of monetary systems: Type 1: Hard money (e.g., metal coins), Type 2: Paper money (claims on hard money) and Type 3: Fiat money.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Hard money is the most restrictive system because money can\u2019t be created unless the supply of the metal or other intrinsically valuable commodity that is the money is increased. Money and credit are more easily created in the second type of system, so the ratio of the claims on hard money to the actual hard money held rises\u2026 The result is a) defaults, when the bank closes its doors and depositors lose their hard assets, and\/or b) devaluations of the claims on money, which mean depositors get back less.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In the third type of system, governments can create money and credit freely\u2026 <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> when the system of hard money and claims on hard money becomes too painfully constrictive, governments typically abandon it in <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">favor<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of what is called \u201cfiat money.\u201d No hard money is involved in fiat systems; there is just paper money that the central bank can print without restriction. As a result, there is no risk that <\/span>the central bank will have its stash of hard money drawn down and <span style=\"color: #000000;\">have to<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> default on its promises to deliver it. Rather, the risk is that, freed from the constraints on the supply of tangible gold, silver, or some other hard asset, the people who control the printing presses (i.e., the central bankers working with the commercial bankers) will create ever more money and debt assets and liabilities in relation to the amount of goods and services being produced until the time comes when those holding the enormous amount of debt will try to turn it in for goods and services, which will [\u2026] result in either debt defaults or the devaluation of money.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When a country needs more money and credit than it currently has, whether to deal with debts, wars, or other problems, it naturally moves from Type 1 to Type 2, or Type 2 to Type 3, so that it has more flexibility to print money. Then creating too much money and debt depreciates their value, causing people to get out of holding debt and money as a <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">storehold<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> of wealth and move back into hard assets (like gold and silver) and other currencies. Since this typically takes place when there is wealth conflict and sometimes war, there is also typically a desire to get out of the country. Such countries need to re-establish confidence in their currency as a store<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">hold of wealth before they can restore their credit markets.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2026 This <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2018<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">big cycle<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u2019<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> typically plays out over something like 50 to 75 years; its ending is characterized by a restructuring of debts and the monetary system itself. The abrupt parts of these restructurings\u2014i.e., the periods of debt and currency crisis\u2014typically happen quickly, lasting only a few months to up to three years, depending on how long it takes the government to act.

    "Passage": "<b>The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions. Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Most species, it turns out, are parasitized by multiple others. Parasites proliferate because every living thing is a smorgasbord of nutrients and energy, and being a top predator isn\u2019t the only way to get a bite of that bounty. Parasites opt out of the arms race between predator and prey entirely, choosing an easier path. It\u2019s clever, when you think about it, and <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">it\u2019s<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> exactly why parasitism is so common. Nature abhors a vacuum. If there\u2019s an opportunity, someone\u2019s going to evolve to fill it.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Parasitism has evolved as a way of life again and again, over billions of years, from the smallest and simplest microbes to the most complex vertebrates.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Yet, we have barely begun to identify all the parasites, much less learn their lifestyles or monitor their populations. One of the things Skylar Hopkins, an ecologist at North Carolina State University, and her colleagues have noticed is what they call the paradox of co-extinction. Since parasites <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">by definition need<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> other species, they\u2019re particularly vulnerable to the phenomenon. Take, for example, the endangered pygmy hog-sucking louse. It lives only on another endangered species, the pygmy hog, which is disappearing from the grasslands it inhabits in the foothills of the Himalaya. Because they\u2019re so sensitive to extinction, it seems likely that many parasite species have already disappeared.<\/span><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The poster child for parasite conservation, if there is one, is the California condor louse, an ironic victim of the conservation movement itself. In the 1970s, desperate to save the California condor, biologists began rearing the birds in captivity. Part of the protocol was to de-louse every bird with pesticides, on the assumption that parasites were bad for condors, though it\u2019s not clear they <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">actually were<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">. The California condor louse hasn\u2019t been seen since. Untold other parasitic worms, protozoans, and insects are presumed to have gone down with the ship, so to speak, as their hosts died out.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">While the demise of life\u2019s hangers-on might seem like no big deal, or even something to strive for, ecologists caution that wiping them all out would probably spell planetary doom. Without parasites keeping them in check, populations of some animals would explode, just as invasive species do when they\u2019re transplanted away from natural predators. Other species would likely crash in the ensuing <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">mel\u00e9e<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Big, charismatic predators would lose out, too. Many parasites have evolved to move into their next host by manipulating the host they\u2019re in, which tends to drive that host into a predator\u2019s mouth. Nematomorph worms, for instance, mature inside crickets but then need to be in water to mate. <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> they influence the crickets\u2019 brains, driving the insects to jump into streams, where they become an important food source for trout. Similar phenomena feed birds, cats, and other predators the world over.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Even human health wouldn\u2019t entirely benefit from wiping out parasites.<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In countries such as the United States, where we have eliminated most intestinal parasites, we have autoimmune diseases that are virtually unheard of in places where everyone still has those parasites. According to one line of thinking, the human immune system evolved with a coterie of worms and protozoan parasites, and when we killed them off, our immune systems began attacking ourselves\u2026<\/span>",

    "Passage": "<b>The passage below is accompanied by a set of questions. Choose the best answer to each question.<\/b><br><br>Current explanations for why humans dance tend to follow one of two approaches. The first, seen in psychological and some philosophical circles, begins with a human as an individual person who chooses to dance (or not) for entertainment, exercise, artistic <span style=\"color: #000000;\">expression<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> or some other personal reason. Such approaches assume that dance is one activity among others offering benefits to an individual that may be desirable, but not necessary, for human wellbeing. Alternatively, a raft of sociological and anthropological explanations <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">focus<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> on community, asserting that dancing is one of the first means by which the earliest humans solidified strong social bonds irrespective of blood lines. In these accounts, dancing is eventually replaced by more rational and effective means of social bonding that the dancing itself makes possible, such as language, <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">morality<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> and religion. While the first type of reasoning struggles to explain why so many humans choose to dance, the second struggles to explain why humans continue to dance. What is missing from these accounts?<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What if humans are the primates whose capacity to dance (shared by some birds and mammals) was the signature strategy enabling the evolution of a distinctively large and interconnected brain, empathic <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">heart<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> and ecological adaptability? And what if dancing plays this role for humans not just in prehistoric times, but continuing into the present? What if humans are creatures who evolved to dance as the enabling condition of their own bodily becoming?<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Recent evidence for such a thesis is gathering across scientific and scholarly disciplines. Time and again, researchers are discovering the vital role played by bodily movement not only in the evolution of the human species, but in the present-day social and psychological development of healthy individuals. Moreover, it is not just bodily movement itself that registers as vital in these cases, but a threefold capacity: to notice and recreate movement patterns; to remember and share movement patterns; and to mobilise these movement patterns as a means for sensing and responding to whatever appears. This threefold capacity is what every dance technique or tradition exercises and educates.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">According to the New York University neuroscientist Rodolfo <\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Llin\u00e1s<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">, bodily movement builds brains. A brain takes shape as it records patterns of neuromuscular coordination, and then remembers the outcomes in terms of pain or pleasure, emotional tags that help it assess whether to mobilise that movement again, and if so, how.<\/span><br><br><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In so far as bodily movements build the brain, every movement a human makes matters. Each repetition of a movement deepens and strengthens the pattern of mind-body coordination that making that movement requires; and the repetition also defines avenues along which future attention and energy flow. Every movement made and remembered shapes how an organism grows \u2013 what it senses and how it responds. From this perspective, every aspect of a human bodily self \u2013 from chromosomal couplet to sense organ to limb shape \u2013 is a capacity for moving that develops through a process of its own movement making.<\/span><br><br>In this sense, a human being is what I call a rhythm of bodily becoming. A human is always creating patterns of bodily movement, where every new movement unfolds along an open-ended trajectory made possible by movements already made. Dancing can be seen as a means of participating in this rhythm of bodily becoming.",

    "Explanation": "<\/span>\t<span style=\"\">The last two paragraphs give us some idea about what the author means by \u201crhythm of bodily becoming\u201d. \u201cIn so far as bodily movements build the brain, every movement a human makes matters. Each repetition of a movement deepens and strengthens the pattern of mind-body coordination that making that movement requires; and the repetition also defines avenues along which future attention and energy flow. (simply put, this is most likely referring to evolution) Every movement made and remembered shapes how an organism grows \u2013 what it senses and how it responds. From this perspective, every aspect of a human bodily self \u2013 from chromosomal couplet to sense organ to limb shape \u2013 is a capacity for moving that develops through a process of its own movement making.\u201d This is what the author calls the \u201crhythm of bodily becoming\u201d. Option 1 best corresponds to this idea. Option 2 talks about the environment, hence incorrect. Option 3 refers to the dancer \u2013 whereas the author is more abstract. Option 4 is only part of the \u2018bodily becoming.\u2019<\/span>\r<br \/><span style=\"\">Hence, [1].<\/span>",

This is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is rejected. <br \/>Case-2: &lsquo;B&rsquo; is Eastern Railways, &lsquo;X&rsquo; is the year 2023-24 and &lsquo;W&rsquo; is the year 2024-25. <br \/>This satisfies all the conditions. However, we do not know the order in which &lsquo;Y&rsquo; and &lsquo;Z&rsquo; represent the last two years (i.e. 2025-26 and 2026-27).&nbsp; <br \/>Case-3: &lsquo;D&rsquo; is Eastern Railways, &lsquo;W&rsquo; is the year 2023-24 and &lsquo;Y&rsquo; is the year 2024-25. <br \/>The number for the year 2025-26 will be 288 which is more than the number of the year 2024-25. This is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is rejected. <br \/>Case-4: &lsquo;E&rsquo; is Eastern Railways, &lsquo;X&rsquo; is the year 2023-24 and &lsquo;Y&rsquo; is the year 2024-25. <br \/>The lowest value possible for Eastern Railways for the year 2025-26 is 216 which is not less than one-third of its previous year number (540 in the year 2024-25). This is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is rejected. <br \/><br \/>Now, the number of &lsquo;A&rsquo;, &lsquo;C&rsquo;, &lsquo;D&rsquo; and &lsquo;E&rsquo; for the year 2024-25 is equal to 360, 450, 180 and 270 respectively.&nbsp; <br \/>&lsquo;A&rsquo; cannot be&nbsp;Western Railways as it has the same number (i.e. 360) for the first two years. &lsquo;D&rsquo; cannot be Western Railways as the number of it cannot be less than 180 for the year 2025-26. &lsquo;E&rsquo; cannot be the Western Railways as the number of it cannot be less than 270 for the year 2025-26. So, &lsquo;C&rsquo; represents Western Railways. <br \/><br \/>Using point 4, we can conclude that &lsquo;Y&rsquo; represents the year 2025-26 and &lsquo;Z&rsquo; represents the year 2026-27.

This is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is rejected. <br \/>Case-2: &lsquo;B&rsquo; is Eastern Railways, &lsquo;X&rsquo; is the year 2023-24 and &lsquo;W&rsquo; is the year 2024-25. <br \/>This satisfies all the conditions. However, we do not know the order in which &lsquo;Y&rsquo; and &lsquo;Z&rsquo; represent the last two years (i.e. 2025-26 and 2026-27).&nbsp; <br \/>Case-3: &lsquo;D&rsquo; is Eastern Railways, &lsquo;W&rsquo; is the year 2023-24 and &lsquo;Y&rsquo; is the year 2024-25. <br \/>The number for the year 2025-26 will be 288 which is more than the number of the year 2024-25. This is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is rejected. <br \/>Case-4: &lsquo;E&rsquo; is Eastern Railways, &lsquo;X&rsquo; is the year 2023-24 and &lsquo;Y&rsquo; is the year 2024-25. <br \/>The lowest value possible for Eastern Railways for the year 2025-26 is 216 which is not less than one-third of its previous year number (540 in the year 2024-25). This is a contradiction. Therefore, this case is rejected. <br \/><br \/>Now, the number of &lsquo;A&rsquo;, &lsquo;C&rsquo;, &lsquo;D&rsquo; and &lsquo;E&rsquo; for the year 2024-25 is equal to 360, 450, 180 and 270 respectively.&nbsp; <br \/>&lsquo;A&rsquo; cannot be Western Railways as it has the same number (i.e. 360) for the first two years. &lsquo;D&rsquo; cannot be Western Railways as the number of it cannot be less than 180 for the year 2025-26. &lsquo;E&rsquo; cannot be the Western Railways as the number of it cannot be less than 270 for the year 2025-26. So, &lsquo;C&rsquo; represents Western Railways. <br \/><br \/>Using point 4, we can conclude that &lsquo;Y&rsquo; represents the year 2025-26 and &lsquo;Z&rsquo; represents the year 2026-27.

It produces all the food items to be sold on any given day only from 5 am to 9 am (referred as &lsquo;Production Hours&rsquo;) in its own kitchen. Production hours are divided into 4 parts: &lsquo;first hour&rsquo; (5 am &ndash; 6 am), &lsquo;second hour&rsquo; (6 am - 7 am), &lsquo;third hour&rsquo; (7 am - 8 am), and &lsquo;fourth hour&rsquo; (8 am - 9 am). The kitchen has only seven production employees (Anu, Baali, Chhottu, Dildaar, Eshan, Fazlul and Giri) who produce only four different types of food items viz. Cake, Bread, Patty and Cookies. Each worker produces only one type of food at the rate of 10 units of finished product in a specific production hour. These seven workers belong to only one of the three different ethnic groups viz. Bengali, Punjabi and Marathi. The following table shows data related to production of food items produced in the kitchen of &lsquo;Tuo Amore&rsquo; on a specific day. Some partial information can also be found about the employees who worked in the kitchen.<br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_1707924596_image3.png\" data-docx-image=\"image3.png\" \/><br \/>If we consider the total number of food items produced in four different production hours, the least number of units of food items were produced in the second hour and the second highest number of units of food items were produced in the fourth hour. These two numbers are different from the other two hourly production numbers.<br \/><br \/>Further the following information is known.<br \/>1. All Punjabi employees always worked in the same production hour.<br \/>2. No two Marathi workers produced the same product. Similarly, no two Punjabi workers produced the same product.<br \/>3. Anu is a Bengali and he worked in only 3 production hours.<br \/>4. Chhottu is Marathi and he produced cakes in exactly 2 production hours.<br \/>5. Eshan doesn&rsquo;t produce cookies and his ethnicity is different from that of Fazlul.<br \/>6. Baali did not work on consecutive production hours. The same is true for Giri. They produce the same food item but never worked in the same business hour.<br \/>7. Cake and bread were made only by the workers of the same ethnicity in any given production hour. <br \/>8. Patty can be made neither by Marathi nor by Punjabi employees.<br \/>9. Cookies can only be made by Punjabi employees.<\/p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>At least 3 workers worked in the second hour and at least 4 workers worked in the fourth hour. So, minimum production in the 2nd and 4th hours are 30 units and 40 units of finished products, respectively. In each of the other two production hours exactly 5 employees worked who produced 50 units of finished products. <br \/>Using the information provided in the table, we can create the following product-wise production details: <br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_690746418_image2.png\" data-docx-image=\"image2.png\" \/> <br \/>In creating the above table, we need to answer whether any cookies were produced in the first hour of production or not. Now, Fazlul can neither be Marathi nor Punjabi. So, we can infer that Anu and Fazlul are Bengali and they produce patty. Thus, Anu didn&rsquo;t work in the 2nd hour. If we assume that no cookies were produced in the first hour then the Punjabi worker, who can produce cookies, did not work in the first hour. In that case, no Punjabi worker worked in the first hour. So, there should be 5 Bengali workers who worked in the first hour. So,&nbsp;Chhottu is the only Marathi worker and there is only one Punjabi worker who produces cookies. Eshan is not a Bengali (point 5). So, Eshan is the only Punjabi worker but he doesn&rsquo;t produce cookies. This is a contradiction. Thus, 20 units of patty and 10 units of cookies were produced in the first production hour.&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Combining the data in the table (i.e. Marathi employees didn&rsquo;t work in the first and third hours) with point 4, we can say that&nbsp;Chhottu, who is Marathi, produced cakes in the second and fourth production hours. Therefore, there is one more Marathi worker who produced bread in the second and fourth production hours. <br \/><br \/>From point 6, either&nbsp;Baali worked in 1st and 3rd hours whereas Giri worked in 2nd and 4th hours, or vice-versa. As they produce the same food item, one of them is Punjabi and the other one is Marathi. We have already established that&nbsp;Chhottu, who is Marathi, produced cakes in the second and fourth production hours. So, if any one of Bali or Giri produces cake then the number of units of cake produced in 2nd and 4th hours should be at least 20. But that is wrong. So,&nbsp;Baali and Giri produce Bread and Eshan produces cake. Thus, Eshan works in the 1st and 3rd hours. He is neither a Bengali nor a Marathi. So, he is a Punjabi and Punjabis worked in the 1st and 3rd hours. So, from point 7, we can infer that if&nbsp;Baali is Punjabi then Giri is Marathi, or vice-versa. Thus,&nbsp;Dildaar is the Punjabi worker who produces cookies. <br \/>Thus, following two possibilities exist: <br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_690746418_image3.png\" data-docx-image=\"image3.png\" \/> <br \/>Baali is either Marathi or Punjabi. <br \/>Hence, [4].<\/p>",

    "Passage": "<p><em><strong>Refer to the instructions below and answer the questions that follow.<\/strong><\/em><br \/><br \/>&lsquo;Tuo Amore&rsquo; is a popular confectionery known for its fresh products produced and sold on the same day. It produces all the food items to be sold on any given day only from 5 am to 9 am (referred as &lsquo;Production Hours&rsquo;) in its own kitchen. Production hours are divided into 4 parts: &lsquo;first hour&rsquo; (5 am &ndash; 6 am), &lsquo;second hour&rsquo; (6 am - 7 am), &lsquo;third hour&rsquo; (7 am - 8 am), and &lsquo;fourth hour&rsquo; (8 am - 9 am). The kitchen has only seven production employees (Anu, Baali, Chhottu, Dildaar, Eshan, Fazlul and Giri) who produce only four different types of food items viz. Cake, Bread, Patty and Cookies. Each worker produces only one type of food at the rate of 10 units of finished product in a specific production hour. These seven workers belong to only one of the three different ethnic groups viz. Bengali, Punjabi and Marathi. The following table shows data related to production of food items produced in the kitchen of &lsquo;Tuo Amore&rsquo; on a specific day. Some partial information can also be found about the employees who worked in the kitchen.<br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_1707924596_image3.png\" data-docx-image=\"image3.png\" \/><br \/>If we consider the total number of food items produced in four different production hours, the least number of units of food items were produced in the second hour and the second highest number of units of food items were produced in the fourth hour. These two numbers are different from the other two hourly production numbers.<br \/><br \/>Further the following information is known.<br \/>1. All Punjabi employees always worked in the same production hour.<br \/>2. No two Marathi workers produced the same product. Similarly, no two Punjabi workers produced the same product.<br \/>3. Anu is a Bengali and he worked in only 3 production hours.<br \/>4. Chhottu is Marathi and he produced cakes in exactly 2 production hours.<br \/>5. Eshan doesn&rsquo;t produce cookies and his ethnicity is different from that of Fazlul.<br \/>6. Baali did not work on consecutive production hours. The same is true for Giri. They produce the same food item but never worked in the same business hour.<br \/>7. Cake and bread were made only by the workers of the same ethnicity in any given production hour. <br \/>8. Patty can be made neither by Marathi nor by Punjabi employees.<br \/>9. Cookies can only be made by Punjabi employees.<\/p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>At least 3 workers worked in the second hour and at least 4 workers worked in the fourth hour. So, minimum production in the 2nd and 4th hours are 30 units and 40 units of finished products, respectively. In each of the other two production hours exactly 5 employees worked who produced 50 units of finished products. <br \/>Using the information provided in the table, we can create the following product-wise production details: <br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_690746418_image2.png\" data-docx-image=\"image2.png\" \/> <br \/>In creating the above table, we need to answer whether any cookies were produced in the first hour of production or not. Now, Fazlul can neither be Marathi nor Punjabi. So, we can infer that Anu and Fazlul are&nbsp;Bengali and they produce patty. Thus, Anu didn&rsquo;t work in the 2nd hour. If we assume that no cookies were produced in the first hour then the Punjabi worker, who can produce cookies, did not work in the first hour. In that case, no Punjabi worker worked in the first hour. So, there should be 5 Bengali workers who worked in the first hour. So,&nbsp;Chhottu is the only Marathi worker and there is only one Punjabi worker who produces cookies. Eshan is not a Bengali (point 5). So, Eshan is the only Punjabi&nbsp;worker but he doesn&rsquo;t produce cookies. This is a contradiction. Thus, 20 units of patty and 10 units of cookies were produced in the first production hour.&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Combining the data in the table (i.e. Marathi employees didn&rsquo;t work in the first and third hours) with point 4, we can say that&nbsp;Chhottu, who is Marathi, produced cakes in the second and fourth production hours. Therefore, there is one more Marathi worker who produced bread in the second and fourth production hours. <br \/><br \/>From point 6, either&nbsp;Baali worked in 1st and 3rd hours whereas Giri worked in 2nd and 4th hours, or vice-versa. As they produce the same food item, one of them is Punjabi and the other one is Marathi. We have already established that&nbsp;Chhottu, who is Marathi, produced cakes in the second and fourth production hours. So, if any one of Bali or Giri produces cake then the number of units of cake produced in 2nd and 4th hours should be at least 20. But that is wrong. So,&nbsp;Baali and Giri produce Bread and Eshan produces cake. Thus, Eshan works in the 1st and 3rd hours. He is neither a Bengali nor a Marathi. So, he is a Punjabi and Punjabis worked in the 1st and 3rd hours. So, from point 7, we can infer that if&nbsp;Baali is Punjabi then Giri is Marathi, or vice-versa. Thus,&nbsp;Dildaar is the Punjabi worker who produces cookies. <br \/>Thus, following two possibilities exist: <br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_690746418_image3.png\" data-docx-image=\"image3.png\" \/> <br \/>Bali produced bread. <br \/>Hence, [4].<\/p>",

Production hours are divided into 4 parts: &lsquo;first hour&rsquo; (5 am &ndash; 6 am), &lsquo;second hour&rsquo; (6 am - 7 am), &lsquo;third hour&rsquo; (7 am - 8 am), and &lsquo;fourth hour&rsquo; (8 am - 9 am). The kitchen has only seven production employees (Anu, Baali, Chhottu, Dildaar, Eshan, Fazlul and Giri) who produce only four different types of food items viz. Cake, Bread, Patty and Cookies. Each worker produces only one type of food at the rate of 10 units of finished product in a specific production hour. These seven workers belong to only one of the three different ethnic groups viz. Bengali, Punjabi and Marathi. The following table shows data related to production of food items produced in the kitchen of &lsquo;Tuo Amore&rsquo; on a specific day. Some partial information can also be found about the employees who worked in the kitchen.<br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_1707924596_image3.png\" data-docx-image=\"image3.png\" \/><br \/>If we consider the total number of food items produced in four different production hours, the least number of units of food items were produced in the second hour and the second highest number of units of food items were produced in the fourth hour. These two numbers are different from the other two hourly production numbers.<br \/><br \/>Further the following information is known.<br \/>1. All Punjabi employees always worked in the same production hour.<br \/>2. No two Marathi workers produced the same product. Similarly, no two Punjabi workers produced the same product.<br \/>3. Anu is a Bengali and he worked in only 3 production hours.<br \/>4. Chhottu is Marathi and he produced cakes in exactly 2 production hours.<br \/>5. Eshan doesn&rsquo;t produce cookies and his ethnicity is different from that of Fazlul.<br \/>6. Baali did not work on consecutive production hours. The same is true for Giri. They produce the same food item but never worked in the same business hour.<br \/>7. Cake and bread were made only by the workers of the same ethnicity in any given production hour. <br \/>8. Patty can be made neither by Marathi nor by Punjabi employees.<br \/>9. Cookies can only be made by Punjabi employees.<\/p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>At least 3 workers worked in the second hour and at least 4 workers worked in the fourth hour. So, minimum production in the 2nd and 4th hours are 30 units and 40 units of finished products, respectively. In each of the other two production hours exactly 5 employees worked who produced 50 units of finished products.<\/p>\n<p>Using the information provided in the table, we can create the following product-wise production details: <br \/><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_690746418_image2.png\" data-docx-image=\"image2.png\" \/> <br \/>In creating the above table, we need to answer whether any cookies were produced in the first hour of production or not. Now, Fazlul can neither be Marathi nor Punjabi. So, we can infer that Anu and Fazlul are&nbsp;Bengali and they produce patty. Thus, Anu didn&rsquo;t work in the 2nd hour. If we assume that no cookies were produced in the first hour then the Punjabi worker, who can produce cookies, did not work in the first hour. In that case, no Punjabi worker worked in the first hour. So, there should be 5 Bengali workers who worked in the first hour. So,&nbsp;Chhottu is the only Marathi worker and there is only one Punjabi worker who produces cookies. Eshan is not a Bengali (point 5). So, Eshan is the only Punjabi&nbsp;worker but he doesn&rsquo;t produce cookies. This is a contradiction. Thus, 20 units of patty and 10 units of cookies were produced in the first production hour.&nbsp; <br \/><br \/>Combining the data in the table (i.e. Marathi employees didn&rsquo;t work in the first and third hours) with point 4, we can say that&nbsp;Chhottu, who is Marathi, produced cakes in the second and fourth production hours. Therefore, there is one more Marathi worker who produced bread in the second and fourth production hours. <br \/><br \/>From point 6, either&nbsp;Baali worked in 1st and 3rd hours whereas Giri worked in 2nd and 4th hours, or vice-versa. As they produce the same food item, one of them is Punjabi and the other one is Marathi. We have already established that&nbsp;Chhottu, who is Marathi, produced cakes in the second and fourth production hours. So, if any one of Bali or Giri produces cake then the number of units of cake produced in 2nd and 4th hours should be at least 20. But that is wrong. So,&nbsp;Baali and Giri produce Bread and Eshan produces cake. Thus, Eshan works in the 1st and 3rd hours. He is neither a Bengali nor a Marathi. So, he is a Punjabi and Punjabis worked in the 1st and 3rd hours. So, from point 7, we can infer that if&nbsp;Baali is Punjabi then Giri is Marathi, or vice-versa. Thus,&nbsp;Dildaar is the Punjabi worker who produces cookies. <br \/>Thus, following two possibilities exist: <br \/><img src=\"http:\/\/campusquizkybv.blob.core.windows.net\/bvcdevitemimages\/docximg_690746418_image3.png\" data-docx-image=\"image3.png\" \/> <br \/>Ethnicity of&nbsp;Baali and Giri cannot be known for certainty. The ethnicity of the other 5 workers can be identified. <br \/>Therefore, the required answer is 5.<\/p>",

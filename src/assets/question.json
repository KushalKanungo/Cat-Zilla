Choose the best answer for each question.</b><br><br> <b><u>  </u></b><br>One of the biggest questions in ageing research is whether there is a ceiling on how long human beings can live. A recent study, published in Science, suggests there isn’t. The study measured the survival probabilities of 3,896 people in Italy aged 105 and older. It found that, while we are much more likely to die at 75 than at 55, once we reach about 105, the odds of death remain about the same each year of life.<br><br>This effect is often referred to as a “mortality plateau”. If it were impossible to live past a certain age, we would expect mortality rates to continue rising as people age, rather than plateau. The fact that the odds of dying don’t appear to increase past 105 suggests that we have not yet approached our maximum lifespan as a species. But is potentially living for over a century something we ought to look forward to? Here, philosophy can offer some important insights.<br><br>Of course, we still don’t know for sure that there is no ceiling. Some researchers argue that there is a natural “expiration date” for human beings, at about 125 years. Chiyo Miyako is currently the oldest known person in the world, at 117 years old. Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997, had the longest recorded lifespan, at 122 years.<br>In the UK, the number of people over the age of 100 has more than doubled since 2002, and could reach 36,000 by 2030. If there is a mortality plateau, by the year 2300 the oldest person alive could be about 150 years old.<br><br>Would a maximum lifespan of 150 make our lives better or just longer? One way of thinking about this is in terms of pleasure and pain: the more pleasure (and the less pain) we have over the course of our lives, the better our lives are. Other things being equal, a life which lasts 100 years is better than one that lasts 80 years, as long as the extra 20 years contain more pleasure than they do pain.<br><br>How likely an outcome is this? As people age, they are much more likely to develop degenerative conditions that could lead to a lower quality of life. But these conditions can be mitigated by a healthy lifestyle and adequate support services.

This could be a parent’s interest in the happiness of their child, for example.<br><br>We can imagine a person having a critical interest in avoiding the perceived indignity of dementia, which may accompany extreme old age.

Choose the best answer for each question.</b><br><br> <b><u>  </u></b><br>One of the biggest questions in ageing research is whether there is a ceiling on how long human beings can live. A recent study, published in Science, suggests there isn’t. The study measured the survival probabilities of 3,896 people in Italy aged 105 and older. It found that, while we are much more likely to die at 75 than at 55, once we reach about 105, the odds of death remain about the same each year of life.<br><br>This effect is often referred to as a “mortality plateau”. If it were impossible to live past a certain age, we would expect mortality rates to continue rising as people age, rather than plateau. The fact that the odds of dying don’t appear to increase past 105 suggests that we have not yet approached our maximum lifespan as a species. But is potentially living for over a century something we ought to look forward to? Here, philosophy can offer some important insights.<br><br>Of course, we still don’t know for sure that there is no ceiling. Some researchers argue that there is a natural “expiration date” for human beings, at about 125 years. Chiyo Miyako is currently the oldest known person in the world, at 117 years old. Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997, had the longest recorded lifespan, at 122 years.<br>In the UK, the number of people over the age of 100 has more than doubled since 2002, and could reach 36,000 by 2030. If there is a mortality plateau, by the year 2300 the oldest person alive could be about 150 years old.<br><br>Would a maximum lifespan of 150 make our lives better or just longer? One way of thinking about this is in terms of pleasure and pain: the more pleasure (and the less pain) we have over the course of our lives, the better our lives are. Other things being equal, a life which lasts 100 years is better than one that lasts 80 years, as long as the extra 20 years contain more pleasure than they do pain.<br><br>How likely an outcome is this? As people age, they are much more likely to develop degenerative conditions that could lead to a lower quality of life.

Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Faced with unfavourable, often seasonal, changes in climate or habitat quality, animals, from birds to butterflies and wildebeests to sea turtles, migrate vast distances—often thousands of miles—in search of more favourable conditions. They return the following year, in many cases to the exact location where their journey began. … We know that some species use the Earth’s magnetic field to navigate with GPS-like precision and others gaze skyward and guide their migration by the stars. We are just now learning that for some animals, the key to a successful migration is all in their heads—complex thought and memory are also necessary for a successful migration. For nearly a decade, we have studied the roles of cognition, learning and memory in the migration of a fairly atypical species—the painted turtle, common to neighbourhood ponds and roadside ditches.</p><p> </p><p>They’re not as charismatic as sea turtles, and they sure don’t travel as far … but what they lack in outward charisma they make up in tenacity. When these turtles take to land each summer, migrating to new habitats when their home ponds dry up, they face seemingly insurmountable odds: scorching heat, dehydration, the crushing tug of gravity, new predatory threats from both land and air, and the ever-present threat of vehicles when crossing a road. <br /><br />Painted turtles at our research site, which is on conservation land within a patchwork of old growth woodlands and agricultural fields, follow long, intricate routes with amazing precision—specific to within a few meters—to far-off, permanent water sources year after year, returning home again when the seasons next change. … To see just where this incredible migratory behaviour came from, we introduced into our site animals without any experience migrating there and monitored their ability to respond to seasonal changes in their habitats. Naive juveniles under four years old learned to navigate the complex paths just as precisely as experienced local turtles and were able to locate far-off water sources. Naive adults could not. <br /><br />How can a turtle possibly think its way through migration? They do it the same way that we do: they form and remember memories of space and place using the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has long been known to play a role in spatial memory in mammals. To test whether the turtle brain also works this way, we gave freely migrating turtles (both experienced adults and naive juveniles) mind-altering drugs that temporarily block acetylcholine in their brains.<br /><br />While the drugs were active and the turtles were without access to spatial memory, the adults with previous experience in the system wandered aimlessly and were unable to follow their traditional migration routes. As soon as the drugs wore off, they got right back on track and were able to successfully migrate to their winter home. And what about naive juvenile turtles? They were unaffected by the drug; they followed the paths perfectly whether on the drug or not. Why? They had no memory to disrupt! This demonstrates that adults use spatial memory to navigate during migration, and that they form these memories as juveniles prior to the age of four.

These mini-cultures, based on everything from ethnic identities to hobbies to life-stages, do indeed “identify and isolate an idea, issue, or group.” <br />2. Social critic Philip Rieff famously dubbed it an “anti-culture,” and its deficiencies, including its therapeutic ethos, partly account for the multitude of mini-cultures that have emerged from it.<br />3. The affiliations and ties provided by such mini-cultures are ultimately fragile and contingent. <br />4. The deep culture of modernity is almost an exclusive celebration of the autonomous individual loosed from all strong commitments and guided only by his or her appetites and preferences.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br />[quizky-text]</p>",

Free time is nothing more than a shadowy continuation of labor; or free time is mere recovery time. <br />2. The problem of figuring out when work is “over,” in an economy in which knowledge workers spend their job hours tweeting and their evening hours doing unpaid housework and child care, has never seemed more perplexing.<br />3. The category of “free” time is not only defined by its opposite, i.e., time “free” of work; but it is subordinated to it. <br />4. The sorry state of our leisure is a consequence of an economy in which we are never fully detached from the demands of work. <br /><br /> <br />[quizky-text]</p>",

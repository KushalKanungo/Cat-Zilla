    Explanation:
      "The argument the author presents is that traits which   currently seem counterintuitive or redundant in living creatures, actually have a basis in evolution - examples in the passage include the attention seeking feathers of birds that attract mates, the human chin that has carried over from larger muscles and jaws for intensive chewing, etc. These examples help the author make arguments that \u201c\u2026strengthen(s) the theory of evolution in that these seemingly weaker individuals are actually showing how well they can do in the face of adversity.\u201d (Paragraph 2 - sentence 5) The author makes the same argument about vestigial too, proving that evolution has a role to play in traits that appear quirky or useless, if one studies them closely. This is also why option 2 is not the correct choice. Besides option 2 is the other end of the extreme, dismissing the role of evolution in any biological trait or characteristic altogether and is therefore not compatible with the views of the author in the passage. Option 3, is not the central argument, and is not true based on the information of the passage - in paragraph 2, the author describes how sexual selection is the reason some birds have ostentatious plumage. There is no mention of the role of sexual selection being larger than it is deemed to be. Option 4 is not correct  because not only is it not the central premise of the passage but it is also incoherent with the information in the passage- \u201cAs human diets changed, the bones and muscles in our jaws became smaller so we didn\u2019t waste energy on them but we were left with a protruding bone at the bottom of the face\u2026Although the chin throws a spandrel in the works, there is nearly always a reason or, at least, an explanation for the myriad traits we see across biology.\u201d The author means therefore, that the chin is not a quirk that exists for its own sake but can actually be traced back to its evolutionary purpose.&nbsp;<span>Hence, [1]</span><span>.</span>",

    Explanation:
      "<p>Sentence 1 & 2 of paragraph 2 make this clear, whereby the author states that despite some species having traits that help them disappear into their surroundings, birds of paradise actually want to be noticed by potential mates. \u201cMany species invest heavily in camouflage and other means of blending into the surroundings to avoid predators. So the physically heavy and downright ostentatious plumage of birds of paradise, peacocks and many other birds seems like a clear invitation to be eaten. But crucially they help these birds pass on their genes because they increase their chances of attracting a mate.\u201d Thus although their feathers are used for survival, they are not used for camouflage. Option 1 is true based on sentence 3 of paragraph 4, \u201cAn evolutionary spandrel is a physical structure or behavioural characteristic that is a by-product from some other functional adaptation.\u201d Option 2 is true based on the passage, because it is a mere re-statement of a line from the passage, Paragraph 3, sentence 3, \u201cIf we could embody evolution as a person, then he or she would be creative but inherently lazy.\u201d Option 4 is not the correct answer because it is true based on sentence 6 of paragraph 3, \u201cMale pythons have little claw-like structures towards the tail, which, although they aid courtship, are all that remain of their hind limbs.\u201d This sentence makes it clear that the claws behind male pythons, originated from their once hind limbs. Therefore Option 4 is true.<span>Hence,\u00a0</span>[3].</p>",

One misconception is that evolution has some innate sense of direction or purpose. In reality, evolution is a mindless, plan-free phenomenon, driven into endless possibilities by random mutations, the most successful of which win out. \u2026. There are some areas of evolutionary biology where benefits are murkier and, in some instances, where traits seem to make no sense at all.

In fact, various aspects of evolutionary biology may seem counterintuitive and could even be seen as a reason to reject evolution as a whole. \u2026\r<br>\r<br>Many species invest heavily in camouflage and other means of blending into the surroundings to avoid predators. So the physically heavy and downright ostentatious plumage of birds of paradise, peacocks and many other birds seems like a clear invitation to be eaten. But crucially they help these birds pass on their genes because they increase their chances of attracting a mate. This is what\u2019s known as sexual selection at its finest. It strengthens the theory of evolution in that these seemingly weaker individuals are actually showing how well they can do in the face of adversity. It\u2019s the evolutionary equivalent of using a pretty over-confident dating profile to impress potential partners.\r<br>\r<br>When an anatomical structure appears frankly inept, it is probably a vestigial trait.

It\u2019s hard to say why they haven\u2019t disappeared altogether but give it another million years and perhaps they will.

    Passage:
      "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />The problem of time is one of the greatest puzzles of modern physics. The first bit of the conundrum is cosmological. To understand time, scientists talk about finding a \u2018First Cause\u2019 or \u2018initial condition\u2019 \u2013 a description of the Universe at the very beginning (or at \u2018time equals zero\u2019). But to determine a system\u2019s initial condition, we need to know the total system. We need to make measurements of the positions and velocities of its constituent parts, such as particles, atoms, fields and so forth. This problem hits a hard wall when we deal with the origin of the Universe itself, because we have no view from the outside. We can\u2019t step outside the box in order to look within, because the box is all there is. A First Cause is not only unknowable, but also scientifically unintelligible.<br /><br />The second part of the challenge is philosophical. Scientists have taken physical time to be the only real time \u2013 whereas experiential time, the subjective sense of time\u2019s passing, is considered a cognitive fabrication of secondary importance. The young Albert Einstein made this position clear in his debate with philosopher Henri Bergson in the 1920s, when he claimed that the physicist\u2019s time is the only time. With age, Einstein became more circumspect. Up to the time of his death, he remained deeply troubled about how to find a place for the human experience of time in the scientific worldview.<br /><br />These quandaries rest on the presumption that physical time, with an absolute starting point, is the only real kind of time. But what if the question of the beginning of time is ill-posed? Many of us like to think that science can give us a complete, objective description of cosmic history, distinct from us and our perception of it. But this image of science is deeply flawed. In our urge for knowledge and control, we\u2019ve created a vision of science as a series of discoveries about how reality is in itself, a God\u2019s-eye view of nature.<br /><br />Such an approach not only distorts the truth, but creates a false sense of distance between ourselves and the world. That divide arises from what we call the Blind Spot, which science itself cannot see. In the Blind Spot site experience:the sheer presence and immediacy of lived perception.<br /><br />Behind the Blind Spot sits the belief that physical reality has absolute primacy in human knowledge, a view that can be called scientific materialism. In philosophical terms, it combines scientific objectivism(science tells us about the real, mind-independent world) and physicalism(science tells us that physical reality is all there is). Elementary particles, moments in time, genes, the brain \u2013 all these things are assumed to be fundamentally real. By contrast, experience, awareness and consciousness are taken to be secondary. The scientific task becomes about figuring out how to reduce them to something physical, such as the behaviour of neural networks,the architecture of computational systems, or some measure of information.</p>",

    Explanation:
      "The central argument of this passage is that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;\u2018Blind Spot\u2019 (or a gap) between the scientific explanations of physical reality, and the subjectivity of perceived human experience which is overlooked by science , often leading to a distorted understanding of reality. Option 2 mentions  that scientific materialism, which is explained by the author as a combination of scientific objectivity and a dependence on physical reality, leads to a distorted understanding of truth by not focusing enough on that which is experiential (experienced). Option 1 is not correct because it talks about the two obstructions to a scientific understanding of the notion of time. While the author talks about time, and the misperception of it due to different variables, that is an example used to build the central argument about science, and not the central argument itself. Option 3, too is not the&nbsp;correct choice because it focuses on the problem of time which is not the central argument but, merely a reference used by the author to build the central argument. Option 4 can be eliminated because it is in complete contrast to what the author is trying to say. In paragraph 5, the author writes&nbsp;\u201cElementary particles, moments in time, genes, the brain&nbsp;</span>\u2013&nbsp;all these things are assumed to be fundamentally real. By contrast, experience, awareness and consciousness are taken to be secondary. The scientific task becomes about figuring out how to reduce them to something physical, such as the behaviour of</span>neural networks,</span>the architecture of computational systems, or some measure of information.\u201d Here the author says that to translate experience, awareness and consciousness into something like systems, behaviors and information is to reduce them. Hence</span>,</span> [2]</span>.</span>",

      "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />The problem of time is one of the greatest puzzles of modern physics. The first bit of the conundrum is cosmological. To understand time, scientists talk about finding a \u2018First Cause\u2019 or \u2018initial condition\u2019 \u2013 a description of the Universe at the very beginning (or at \u2018time equals zero\u2019). But to determine a system\u2019s initial condition, we need to know the total system. We need to make measurements of the positions and velocities of its constituent parts, such as particles, atoms, fields and so forth. This problem hits a hard wall when we deal with the origin of the Universe itself, because we have no view from the outside. We can\u2019t step outside the box in order to look within, because the box is all there is. A First Cause is not only unknowable, but also scientifically unintelligible.<br /><br />The second part of the challenge is philosophical. Scientists have taken physical time to be the only real time \u2013 whereas experiential time, the subjective sense of time\u2019s passing, is considered a cognitive fabrication of secondary importance. The young Albert Einstein made this position clear in his debate with philosopher Henri Bergson in the 1920s, when he claimed that the physicist\u2019s time is the only time. With age, Einstein became more circumspect. Up to the time of his death, he remained deeply troubled about how to find a place for the human experience of time in the scientific worldview.<br /><br />These quandaries rest on the presumption that physical time, with an absolute starting point, is the only real kind of time. But what if the question of the beginning of time is ill-posed? Many of us like to think that science can give us a complete, objective description of cosmic history, distinct from us and our perception of it. But this image of science is deeply flawed. In our urge for knowledge and control, we\u2019ve created a vision of science as a series of discoveries about how reality is in itself, a God\u2019s-eye view of nature.<br /><br />Such an approach not only distorts the truth, but creates a false sense of distance between ourselves and the world. That divide arises from what we call the Blind Spot, which science itself cannot see. In the Blind Spot site experience:the sheer presence and immediacy of lived perception.<br /><br />Behind the Blind Spot sits the belief that physical reality has absolute primacy in human knowledge, a view that can be called scientific materialism. In philosophical terms, it combines scientific objectivism(science tells us about the real, mind-independent world) and physicalism(science tells us that physical reality is all there is). Elementary particles, moments in time, genes, the brain \u2013 all these things are assumed to be fundamentally real. By contrast, experience, awareness and consciousness are taken to be secondary. The scientific task becomes about figuring out how to reduce them to something physical, such as the behaviour of neural networks,the architecture of computational systems, or some measure of information.</p>",

    Explanation:
      "<p>Option 1 is not in agreement with the passage because the passage describes that Einstein who subscribed to the scientists view that \u2018physicist\u2019s time is the only time\u2019 did not uphold the view in his later years. He became interested in experiential or relative time, \u201cUp to the time of his death, he remained deeply troubled about how to find a place for the human experience of time in the scientific worldview.\u201d Option 2<strong></strong>is in agreement with the passage. This is clear in the very opening of the passage, Paragraph 1, sentence 3: \u201cTo understand time, scientists talk about finding a\u00a0\u2018First Cause\u2019 or \u2018initial condition\u2019 \u2013\u00a0a description of the Universe at the very beginning (or at\u00a0\u2018time equals zero\u2019).\u201d Option 3 is also based on the argument the author presents in paragraph 3, stating that the objectivity of science often leaves out subjective perception. \u201cMany of us like to think that science can give us a complete, objective description of cosmic history, distinct from us and our perception of it. But this image of science is deeply flawed. In our urge for knowledge and control, we\u2019ve created a vision of science as a series of discoveries about how reality is in itself, a God\u2019s-eye view of nature.\u201d The loophole in Option 3 is the \u201cBlind Spot\u201d that the author talks of through the rest of this passage. Option 4 is a rephrasing of\u00a0the first sentence of paragraph 5, \u201cBehind the Blind Spot sits the belief that physical reality has absolute primacy in human knowledge, a view that can be calledscientific materialism.\u201d Hence, [1].</p>",

      "<p>Option 1is not true about\u00a0\u201cFirst Cause\u201d in the context of this passage. It is the state when time was equal to zero, and not the \u201cfoundational reason\u201d for time \u2013 it is not said to have \u2018caused\u2019 time.\u00a0Based on the passage, option 2 is correct because the author states in paragraph 1 sentence 3 that scientists talk about a First Cause- or a condition in the Universe when time was zero: \u201cTo understand time, scientists talk about finding a\u00a0\u2018First Cause\u2019 or \u2018initial condition\u2019 \u2013\u00a0a description of the Universe at the very beginning (or at\u00a0\u2018time equals zero\u2019).\u201d\u00a0Option 3 is also true about First Cause; it can be deduced from paragraph 1, sentence 4-5, where the author states that in order to understand the First Cause, an outsider perspective of the Universe would be necessary, but the totality of our experience is contained in the Universe, and therefore stepping out of it is not possible. Option 4 is merely a reworded form of the last line in the first paragraph: \u201cA First Cause is not only unknowable, but also scientifically unintelligible.\u201d I.e. it will never be known or understood.

    Explanation:
      "<p>Throughout the passage the author talks about a God\u2019s eye view - or an objective, external view of things that science takes, in contrast to an ant-eye view of human consciousness, or subjective experience which option 3 describes as \u2018fixed totality of mind independent objects\u201d. Option 1 can be eliminated because the passage does not speak oftheology or\u00a0religion; Option 2 is incorrect because it is referring to a subjective viewpoint, which is in conflict with the sentences in paragraph 3 that priced this sentence \u201cMany of us like to think that science can give us a complete, objective description of cosmic history, distinct from us and our perception of it. But this image of science is deeply flawed.\u201d The clue that helps eliminate Option 4, is the phrase \u2018emotionally detached\u2019 which is not apparent anywhere in the arguments presented in the passage. Hence, [3].</p>",

    Passage:
      "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Like a brain, an ant colony operates without central control. Each is a set of interacting individuals, either neurons or ants, using simple chemical interactions that in the aggregate generate their behaviour. People use their brains to remember. Can ant colonies do that? This question leads to another question: what is memory? For people, memory is the capacity to recall something that happened in the past. We also ask computers to reproduce past actions \u2013 the blending of the idea of the computer as brain and brain as computer has led us to take \u2018memory\u2019 to mean something like the information stored on a hard drive. We know that our memory relies on changes in how much a set of linked neurons stimulate each other; that it is reinforced somehow during sleep; and that recent and long-term memory involve different circuits of connected neurons. But there is much we still don\u2019t know about how those neural events come together, whether there are stored representations that we use to talk about something that happened in the past, or how we can keep performing a previously learned task such as reading or riding a bicycle.<br /><br />Any living being can exhibit the simplest form of memory, a change due to past events. Look at a tree that has lost a branch. It remembers by how it grows around the wound, leaving traces in the pattern of the bark and the shape of the tree. You might be able to describe the last time you had the flu, or you might not. Either way, in some sense your body \u2018remembers\u2019, because some of your cells now have different antibodies, molecular receptors, which fit that particular virus.<br /><br />Past events can alter the behaviour of both individual ants and ant colonies. Individual carpenter ants offered a sugar treat remembered its location for a few minutes; they were likely to return to where the food had been. Another species, the Sahara Desert ant, meanders around the barren desert, searching for food. It appears that an ant of this species can remember how far it walked, or how many steps it took, since the last time it was at the nest.<br /><br />A redwood ant colony remembers its trail system leading to the same trees, year after year, although no single ant does. In the forests of Europe, they forage in high trees to feed on the excretions of aphids that in turn feed on the tree. Their nests are enormous mounds of pine needles situated in the same place for decades, occupied by many generations of colonies. Each ant tends to take the same trail day after day to the same tree. During the long winter, the ants huddle together under the snow. The Finnish myrmecologist Rainer Rosengren showed that when the ants emerge in the spring, an older ant goes out with a young one along the older ant\u2019s habitual trail. The older ant dies and the younger ant adopts that trail as its own, thus leading the colony to remember, or reproduce, the previous year\u2019s trails.</p>",

    Explanation:
      "<p>The passage predominantly describes the role of memory in ant colonies and individual ants, citing examples of redwood ant colonies, Sahara Desert ants and carpenter ants. The author constructs this argument by building a larger argument around what memory is, and how it shapesbehaviour in trees, humans and ants. Option 1 is an incorrect option because although the passage makes reference to the retention and retrieval of memory among ant colonies and individual ants, it doesn\u2019t make any reference to codes and means of functioning. Option 3 can be eliminated because the passage does not compare the red wood ants with the Sahara Desert Ant - In Paragraph 3 the author describes the memory of the Sahara desert ant, and in paragraph 4, he describes the red wood ant, without any comparison between the two. Option 4 is incorrect because the only reference the passage makes to the memories of ants is at the opening of the passage, \u201cLike a brain, an ant colony operates without central control. Each is a set of interacting individuals, either neurons or ants, using simple chemical\u00a0interactions that in the aggregate generate their behaviour.\u201d There is no evidence in the passage of linked traces stored in the neurons. Hence, [2].</p>",

    Explanation:
      "It is best to understand why the author has used this sentence by studying the context - This sentence appears in paragraph 2 of the passa</span>ge, where the author is explaining</span> what memory is in its simplest form.&nbsp;</span>First, t</span>he paragraph cites the examples of trees and then the example of the human body, in supporting the argument that, \u201cAny living being can exhibit the simplest form of memory, a change due to past events.\u201d (paragraph 2, sentence 1). Option 2 and 3 are not correct options because the author is neither contradicting his argument, nor is he refuting what memory is conventionally described as. If anything, he is confirming that this is an example of the simplest form of memory. Option 4 is not the correct choice , because the author explains how memory involves the brain and neurons, in paragraph 1 - \u201c \u2026and brain as computer has led us to take \u2018memory\u2019 to mean something like the information stored on a hard drive. We know that our memory relies on changes in how much a set of linked neurons stimulate each other; that it is reinforced somehow during sleep; and that recent and long-term memory involve different circuits of connected neurons.\u201d He then goes on to describe how these changes lead to changes in&nbsp;</span>behaviour</span>, and does not distinguish between memory in the body v/s memory in the brain. Hence</span>,</span> [1]</span>.</span>",

      "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Like a brain, an ant colony operates without central control. Each is a set of interacting individuals, either neurons or ants, using simple chemical interactions that in the aggregate generate their behaviour. People use their brains to remember. Can ant colonies do that? This question leads to another question: what is memory? For people, memory is the capacity to recall something that happened in the past. We also ask computers to reproduce past actions \u2013 the blending of the idea of the computer as brain and brain as computer has led us to take \u2018memory\u2019 to mean something like the information stored on a hard drive. We know that our memory relies on changes in how much a set of linked neurons stimulate each other; that it is reinforced somehow during sleep; and that recent and long-term memory involve different circuits of connected neurons. But there is much we still don\u2019t know about how those neural events come together, whether there are stored representations that we use to talk about something that happened in the past, or how we can keep performing a previously learned task such as reading or riding a bicycle.<br /><br />Any living being can exhibit the simplest form of memory, a change due to past events. Look at a tree that has lost a branch. It remembers by how it grows around the wound, leaving traces in the pattern of the bark and the shape of the tree. You might be able to describe the last time you had the flu, or you might not. Either way, in some sense your body \u2018remembers\u2019, because some of your cells now have different antibodies, molecular receptors, which fit that particular virus.<br /><br />Past events can alter the behaviour of both individual ants and ant colonies. Individual carpenter ants offered a sugar treat remembered its location for a few minutes; they were likely to return to where the food had been. Another species, the Sahara Desert ant, meanders around the barren desert, searching for food. It appears that an ant of this species can remember how far it walked, or how many steps it took, since the last time it was at the nest.<br /><br />A redwood ant colony remembers its trail system leading to the same trees, year after year, although no single ant does.

      '<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of </strong><strong>4</strong><strong> questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Laypersons and academics alike have largely viewed creativity as a positive force, a notion challenged by the philosopher and educator Robert McLaren of California State University, Fullerton in 1993. <span style="color: #000000;">McLaren proposed\u00a0</span>that creativity had a dark side.

The now infamous comedian Louis CK uses black comedy in his acts as well as his namesake television show. His work was disturbing yet hilarious \u2013 until he went too far, joking about high-school students massacred with guns. One can argue that dark humour has the potential to psychologically harm others \u2013 but dark jokes made with intent to elicit laughter highlight the importance of distinguishing means and ends in creative pursuits.</p>',

    Explanation:
      "<p><span>The phrase \u201cslippery slope\u201d means \u2018an idea or course of action which will lead to something unacceptable, wrong, or disastrous\u2019. The author uses this in relation to the end goal of creativity differentiating between using creativity for planning a birthday party v/s using it to perform a surprise threat. Sentences 3 & 4 of paragraph 4 help in understanding this: \u201cCan we then channel our dark energies to bring joy to others? Sure; but this can become a slippery slope. If the goal switches to planning a surprise theft, the same skills can harm others.\u201d What this means is that if one slips into the trap of negatively harnessing creativity, it can cause damage. Option 2 is incorrect, because the sentence does not make any claim about a reduction in creativity. Option 3 is also incorrect, because neither preceding nor following sentences speak about a person\u2019s intelligence. Option 4 is an incorrect option because the author does not make a correlation between the da</span><span>rk side of creativity and time.</span> <br /><span>Hence, [1].</span></p>",

    Explanation:
      "<p><span>While the passage makes a reference to an indecisive customer, it does so in the context of advertisers cashing in on a customer\u2019s indecisiveness i.e. using it to their advantage - paragraph 5, sentence 3, \u201cSure; it\u2019s an underhand way to get through to your undecided consumer.\u201d It does not say anything about ridiculing it. Hence Option 3 is not true based on the passage. Option 1 is true based on sentence 1 and 2 of paragraph 5, \u201cThe dark art has been here all along. Just consider some innovative advertising campaigns deriding a competitor\u2019s product in favour of one\u2019s own\u2026\u201d Option 2 is also true. In sentence 2 of the same paragraph, the author writes, \u201cJust consider some innovative advertising campaigns deriding a competitor\u2019s product in favour of one\u2019s own: the cola wars, the burger wars and the coffee wars are all notorious for hinting at the competition\u2019s lower quality, with direct or indirect references.\u201d Thus it is true that advertising aims at products competing with each other. Option 4 is also true. This can be deduced from the last sentence of paragraph 5, the author writes, \u201cDefinitely \u2013 it\u2019s (advertising is) meant to increase your profit in a competitive world</span><span>.

    Passage:
      '<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of </strong><strong>4</strong><strong> questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Laypersons and academics alike have largely viewed creativity as a positive force, a notion challenged by the philosopher and educator Robert McLaren of California State University, Fullerton in 1993. <span style="color: #000000;">McLaren proposed\u00a0</span>that creativity had a dark side. As time went on, newer concepts \u2013<span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #000000;">negative</span>\u00a0and\u00a0malevolent<span style="text-decoration: underline;">\u00a0</span>creativity \u2013 included conceiving original ways to cheat on tests or doing purposeful harm to others, for instance, innovating new ways to execute terrorist attacks.</p><p><br />We looked at the problem through what psychologists call the four Ps of creativity \u2013 person (the individual engaging in the act), process (the strategy employed), product (the creative outcome itself), and press (the situation at hand.) After a series of five experiments, we concluded that negative creativity (product) is most likely to be displayed by highly intelligent persons, with subclinical negative personality traits such as psychopathy, especially in open-ended situations where deception can succeed. When creative people had a negative, morally questionable goal up-front, they were also more likely to lie.<br /><br />We confirmed the contention that the dark side of creativity exists, and is one that it\u2019s important to acknowledge and understand. People can get hurt in surprising and original ways by practitioners of this dark craft. And, just as important, an entire set of misbehaviours with the potential to help us learn more about human creativity may be going unnoticed and ignored.<br /><br />What if, after knowing that the dark side exists, we consciously try to use it? Is that really always bad? Perhaps we won\u2019t lie to get into a theatre \u2013 but what if a surprise birthday party for a friend requires sly and crafty planning, coordination, and a great deal of deception and misdirection? Can we then channel our dark energies to bring joy to others? Sure; but this can become a slippery slope. If the goal switches to planning a surprise theft, the same skills can harm others.<br /><br />The dark art has been here all along. Just consider some innovative advertising campaigns deriding a competitor\u2019s product in favour of one\u2019s own: the cola wars, the burger wars and the coffee wars are all notorious for hinting at the competition\u2019s lower quality, with direct or indirect references. Is this dark? Sure; it\u2019s an underhand way to get through to your undecided consumer. Is it creative? Of course! Should it be used? Definitely \u2013 it\u2019s meant to increase your profit in a competitive world.<br /><br />Dark humour should take a bow, as well. To be able to come up with a dead-baby joke, one needs not only a punch line, but a macabre one. To be able to laugh at such a joke, one needs to have a strong stomach and keep moralistic thinking at bay. The now infamous comedian Louis CK uses black comedy in his acts as well as his namesake television show. His work was disturbing yet hilarious \u2013 until he went too far, joking about high-school students massacred with guns. One can argue that dark humour has the potential to psychologically harm others \u2013 but dark jokes made with intent to elicit laughter highlight the importance of distinguishing means and ends in creative pursuits.</p>',

    Explanation:
      "<p>The first paragraph states laymen and academics view creativity as positive. McLaren, however, proposed a dark side to it \u2013 when it is viewed without a moral lens. This leads to our limited understanding of creativity. The problem lay in creativity being understood without the social and moral lens. Hence option 1 is the problem. Option 2 is an example, and option 3 is an aspect of creativity. Option 4 in itself is not the problem \u2013 the problem is limited understanding of creativity. Hence,<span>[</span><span>1</span><span>].</span><span>\u00a0</span></p>",

But the info is limited. Satellite data often tells you what happens after it's happened. Sound recordings can supplement satellite data, as another conservation tool. So you can hear things like chainsaws or gunshots in real time. So you can get out ahead of potential deforestation before it occurs. Small audio recorders, some of which are solar-powered and hooked to cell phone grids for data upload, also give ecologists the ability to eavesdrop on a jungle's biodiversity over time. If you're in a primary forest, you'll tend to see all the frequencies of the soundscape occupied by different species. As you move into a more disturbed ecosystem, you'd start to see more gaps across the frequencies of that soundscape. Certain insects dominate. And the diversity of calls declines as disturbance increases.",

    Explanation:
      "<p>Answer: Option <strong>4213.</strong> The phrase, \u2018this island\u2019 in sentence 2 connects to \u2018a small island in the vast ocean of ignorance\u2019 in sentence 4 \u2013 hence 42 is a mandatory pair. \u2018\u2026the activity of gaining knowledge\u2019 in sentence 1 is an explanation of \u2018the scientific enterprise is all about.\u2019 Hence 42 is followed by sentence 1. The contrast in sentence 3 beginning with \u2018still\u2019 comes suitably after sentence 1. 4-2 and 1-3 being mandatory pairs, 1342 is another plausible sequence. (The emphasis changes from the theme of 'limited scientific knowledge of the universe to the 'fun activity of gaining knowledge') However, \u201cto learn all at once of the discoveries of an alien civilization...\u2019 in sentence 3 makes better sense when the idea of \u201cour (limited) current knowledge of the universe\u2026\u201d is already introduced.\u00a0 Hence, 4213\u00a0</p>",

      "<p>Sentence 2 can only be result of what is stated in sentence 4. Hence 2 must follow 4. Neither 1 nor 3 can be placed before the 4-2 pair. Thus, the pair 42 starts the paragraph and sentence 3 and 1 follow the pair in that order.

    Explanation:
      "Answer: Option 4. The clue to discovering the theme lies in sentence 1 and then sentence 5. Both talk about the situation \u2018when someone is \u201cwithout an ID\u2026.\u201d Sentence 3 beginning with \u2018but\u2019 ask us&nbsp;to \u2018imagine for a moment that you are one of the estimated one billion people in the world\u2026who have no official identification.\u2019 Thus it is still related to the theme of sentences 1 and 5. Thus sentences 1, 2 and 5 are closely related. \u201cBut\u201d in sentence 3 helps us to relate sentence 3 to sentence 2 as \u2026.  We have many ways to prove our identity\u2026.. but imagine you are one of those who have no official identification. So sentence 4 beginning with \u2018at the same time\u2026 \u2018is a misfit. Hence, 4",

    Explanation:
      '<p>From Rahul\'s statement we can say that Sachin arrived first and Rahul arrived second. From Zaheer\'s statement we can say that Mahendra arrived third to the party and Zaheer arrived fourth.</p>\n<p>Mahendra and Rahul left immediately after Zaheer arrived. From Mahendra\'s statement, when he returned to the party, Sachin was still there and the only new person he met was Rohit. This means that Rohit arrived after Rahul and Mahendra left the party.</p>\n<p>According to Dinesh\'s statement he took Sachin with him. At that time only Sachin, Zaheer and Rohit were at the party</p>\n<p>Also, from Sachin\'s statement we can say that after Sachin left the party with Dinesh, Virat arrived at the party and Zaheer left the party (which could have occured in any order).</p>\n<p class="expans">The two orders are tabulated as below:</p>\n<p>Case I:</p>\n<p>\u00a0<img src="https://imsclick2cert.blob.core.windows.net/imsitemimages/636910322315599438_6378961.PNG" alt="" width="447" height="306" /></p>\n<p>\u00a0Case II:</p>\n<p>\u00a0<img src="https://imsclick2cert.blob.core.windows.net/imsitemimages/636910321888329412_4679539.PNG" alt="" /></p>\n<p>We cannot determine whether Zaheer left the party before Virat arrived or after Virat arrived. Therefore we cannot determine the number of friends Virat met at the party. Hence, [4].</p>',

    Passage:
      '<b> </b><b>The</b><b> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</b>\r<br>\r<br>What does it take to be a good person? What makes someone a good doctor, therapist or parent? What guides policy-makers to make wise and moral decisions? Many believe that empathy \u2014 the capacity to experience the feelings of others, and particularly others\u2019 suffering \u2014 is essential to all of these roles. I argue that this is a mistake, often a tragic one.\r<br>\r<br>Empathy acts like a spotlight, focusing one\'s attention on a single individual in the here and now. This can have positive effects, but it can also lead to short-sighted and unfair moral actions. And it is subject to bias \u2014 both laboratory studies and anecdotal experiences show that empathy flows most for those who look like us, who are attractive and who are non-threatening and familiar. \r<br>\r<br>When we appreciate that skin color does not determine who we should care about, for example, or that a crisis such as climate change has great significance \u2014 even though it is an abstract threat \u2014 we are transcending empathy. A good policy maker makes decisions using reason, aspiring toward the sort of fairness and impartiality empathy doesn\'t provide. Empathy isn\u2019t just a reflex, of course. We can choose to empathize and stir empathy for others. But this flexibility can be a curse. Our empathy can be exploited by others, as when cynical politicians tell stories of victims of rape or assault and use our empathy for these victims to stoke hatred against vulnerable groups, such as undocumented immigrants. \r<br>\r<br>For those in the helping professions, compassion and understanding are critically important. But not empathy \u2014 feeling the suffering of others too acutely leads to exhaustion, burnout and ineffective work. No good therapist is awash with anxiety when working with an anxious patient. Some distance is required. The essayist Leslie Jamison has a great description of this, in writing about a good doctor who helped her: \u201cHis calmness didn\u2019t make me feel <span style="font-family: MS Gothic;"></span>abandoned, it made me feel secure," she wrote. "I wanted to look at him and see the opposite of my fear, not its echo.\u201d</span> <span style="font-family: MS Gothic;"></span> Or consider a parent dealing with a teenager who is panicked because she left her homework to the last minute. It\u2019s hardly good parenting to panic along with her. Good parents care for their children and understand them, but don\u2019t necessarily absorb their suffering. \r<br>\r<br>Rationality alone isn\u2019t enough to be a good person; you also need some sort of motivation. But compassion \u2014 caring for others without feeling their pain \u2014 does the trick quite nicely. Empathy and compassion are distinct: Recent neuroscience studies, including some fascinating work on the power of meditation, show that compassion is distinct from empathy, with all its benefits and few of its costs. Many of life\u2019s deepest pleasures, such as engagement with novels, movies and television, require empathic connection. Empathy has its place. But when it comes to being a good person, there are better alternatives.',

    Explanation:
      "<p>Paragraph 5 says that \u201cempathy and compassion are distinct...\u201d Though, nowhere does the passage say that they are often used interchangeably. All through the passage, the author tries to discard the unnecessary importance that we attribute to empathy with regard to providing assistance to somebody in need. Therefore, option [3] is incorrect in associating empathy with humaneness (as far as the passage is concerned). Refer paragraph 5: \u201cEmpathy has its place. But when it comes to being a good person, there are better alternatives.\u201d Though, the passage is not all about the many alternatives we can avail in the process of being a good person, as option [4] claims. It aims to enlighten its readers about the ineffectiveness of empathy when it comes to being of use to another person. Option [1] rightly states the author\u2019s central argument.<span>Hence, [1].</span></p>",

    Passage:
      '<b> </b><b>The</b><b> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</b>\r<br>\r<br>What does it take to be a good person? What makes someone a good doctor, therapist or parent? What guides policy-makers to make wise and moral decisions? Many believe that empathy \u2014 the capacity to experience the feelings of others, and particularly others\u2019 suffering \u2014 is essential to all of these roles. I argue that this is a mistake, often a tragic one.\r<br>\r<br>Empathy acts like a spotlight, focusing one\'s attention on a single individual in the here and now. This can have positive effects, but it can also lead to short-sighted and unfair moral actions. And it is subject to bias \u2014 both laboratory studies and anecdotal experiences show that empathy flows most for those who look like us, who are attractive and who are non-threatening and familiar. \r<br>\r<br>When we appreciate that skin color does not determine who we should care about, for example, or that a crisis such as climate change has great significance \u2014 even though it is an abstract threat \u2014 we are transcending empathy. A good policy maker makes decisions using reason, aspiring toward the sort of fairness and impartiality empathy doesn\'t provide. Empathy isn\u2019t just a reflex, of course. We can choose to empathize and stir empathy for others. But this flexibility can be a curse. Our empathy can be exploited by others, as when cynical politicians tell stories of victims of rape or assault and use our empathy for these victims to stoke hatred against vulnerable groups, such as undocumented immigrants. \r<br>\r<br>For those in the helping professions, compassion and understanding are critically important. But not empathy \u2014 feeling the suffering of others too acutely leads to exhaustion, burnout and ineffective work. No good therapist is awash with anxiety when working with an anxious patient. Some distance is required. The essayist Leslie Jamison has a great description of this, in writing about a good doctor who helped her: \u201cHis calmness didn\u2019t make me feel <span style="font-family: MS Gothic;"></span>abandoned, it made me feel secure," she wrote. "I wanted to look at him and see the opposite of my fear, not its echo.\u201d</span> <span style="font-family: MS Gothic;"></span> Or consider a parent dealing with a teenager who is panicked because she left her homework to the last minute.

    Explanation:
      "<p>Option 1 is empathy itself hence not the transcending of it. Option 2 is incorrect, because we do not transcend by giving up our identity with the other\u2013 e.g., a white man need not give up his identity and identify himself with blacks. Even this may be the conventional definition of empathy and not transcending it. In other words, \u2018trying to be in another person\u2019s shoes\u2019 is not transcending empathy. Option 3 is the convenient form of empathy - for people who are like us. Option 4 is correct. The passage states: \u201cWhen we appreciate that<span>skin\u00a0</span><span>color</span><span> does not determine who we should care about</span><span>, for example, or that a crisis such as climate change has great significance \u2014 even though it is an abstract threat \u2014\u00a0</span><span>we are transcending empathy</span><span>.\u201d In effect, we choose to care about people without the distinction of ethnicity or ideology, we transcend empathy. Hence option 4 expresses the same idea.\u00a0</span><span>Hence, [4].</span></p>",

      "<b>The</b><b> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</b><br><br> <b><u>  </u></b><br>One of the biggest questions in ageing research is whether there is a ceiling on how long human beings can live. A recent study, published in Science, suggests there isn\u2019t. The study measured the survival probabilities of 3,896 people in Italy aged 105 and older. It found that, while we are much more likely to die at 75 than at 55, once we reach about 105, the odds of death remain about the same each year of life.<br><br>This effect is often referred to as a \u201cmortality plateau\u201d. If it were impossible to live past a certain age, we would expect mortality rates to continue rising as people age, rather than plateau. The fact that the odds of dying don\u2019t appear to increase past 105 suggests that we have not yet approached our maximum lifespan as a species. But is potentially living for over a century something we ought to look forward to? Here, philosophy can offer some important insights.<br><br>Of course, we still don\u2019t know for sure that there is no ceiling. Some researchers argue that there is a natural \u201cexpiration date\u201d for human beings, at about 125 years. Chiyo Miyako is currently the oldest known person in the world, at 117 years old. Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997, had the longest recorded lifespan, at 122 years.<br>In the UK, the number of people over the age of 100 has more than doubled since 2002, and could reach 36,000 by 2030. If there is a mortality plateau, by the year 2300 the oldest person alive could be about 150 years old.<br><br>Would a maximum lifespan of 150 make our lives better or just longer? One way of thinking about this is in terms of pleasure and pain: the more pleasure (and the less pain) we have over the course of our lives, the better our lives are. Other things being equal, a life which lasts 100 years is better than one that lasts 80 years, as long as the extra 20 years contain more pleasure than they do pain.<br><br>How likely an outcome is this? As people age, they are much more likely to develop degenerative conditions that could lead to a lower quality of life. But these conditions can be mitigated by a healthy lifestyle and adequate support services. While elderly life may be restricted in some ways, there is no reason that it cannot be, on balance, pleasurable.<br><br>The late philosopher Ronald Dworkin distinguished between \u201cexperiential interests\u201d and \u201ccritical interests\u201d to shed light on how people may view their life goals. Experiential interests are for things like pleasure \u2013 anything we enjoy. Critical interests are those that we value becoming a reality \u2013 essential to what we think constitutes a good life. This could be a parent\u2019s interest in the happiness of their child, for example.<br><br>We can imagine a person having a critical interest in avoiding the perceived indignity of dementia, which may accompany extreme old age. We might think it would be better for this person, taking the whole of their life into account, if they had died prior to this period of decline.",

    Passage:
      "<b>The</b><b> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</b><br><br> <b><u>  </u></b><br>One of the biggest questions in ageing research is whether there is a ceiling on how long human beings can live. A recent study, published in Science, suggests there isn\u2019t. The study measured the survival probabilities of 3,896 people in Italy aged 105 and older. It found that, while we are much more likely to die at 75 than at 55, once we reach about 105, the odds of death remain about the same each year of life.<br><br>This effect is often referred to as a \u201cmortality plateau\u201d. If it were impossible to live past a certain age, we would expect mortality rates to continue rising as people age, rather than plateau. The fact that the odds of dying don\u2019t appear to increase past 105 suggests that we have not yet approached our maximum lifespan as a species. But is potentially living for over a century something we ought to look forward to? Here, philosophy can offer some important insights.<br><br>Of course, we still don\u2019t know for sure that there is no ceiling. Some researchers argue that there is a natural \u201cexpiration date\u201d for human beings, at about 125 years. Chiyo Miyako is currently the oldest known person in the world, at 117 years old. Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997, had the longest recorded lifespan, at 122 years.<br>In the UK, the number of people over the age of 100 has more than doubled since 2002, and could reach 36,000 by 2030. If there is a mortality plateau, by the year 2300 the oldest person alive could be about 150 years old.<br><br>Would a maximum lifespan of 150 make our lives better or just longer? One way of thinking about this is in terms of pleasure and pain: the more pleasure (and the less pain) we have over the course of our lives, the better our lives are. Other things being equal, a life which lasts 100 years is better than one that lasts 80 years, as long as the extra 20 years contain more pleasure than they do pain.<br><br>How likely an outcome is this? As people age, they are much more likely to develop degenerative conditions that could lead to a lower quality of life. But these conditions can be mitigated by a healthy lifestyle and adequate support services. While elderly life may be restricted in some ways, there is no reason that it cannot be, on balance, pleasurable.<br><br>The late philosopher Ronald Dworkin distinguished between \u201cexperiential interests\u201d and \u201ccritical interests\u201d to shed light on how people may view their life goals. Experiential interests are for things like pleasure \u2013 anything we enjoy. Critical interests are those that we value becoming a reality \u2013 essential to what we think constitutes a good life. This could be a parent\u2019s interest in the happiness of their child, for example.<br><br>We can imagine a person having a critical interest in avoiding the perceived indignity of dementia, which may accompany extreme old age. We might think it would be better for this person, taking the whole of their life into account, if they had died prior to this period of decline.",

While elderly life may be restricted in some ways, there is no reason that it cannot be, on balance, pleasurable.\u201d(<span>Eliminates option 2</span><span>) The following sentences after the query state that the hypothesis stated prior to the query, is perfectly plausible given certain facts.\u201d Thus the phrase is intended to lead from theory to rationale.</span><span>Hence, [3].</span></p>",

    Passage:
      "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Faced with unfavourable, often seasonal, changes in climate or habitat quality, animals, from birds to butterflies and wildebeests to sea turtles, migrate vast distances\u2014often thousands of miles\u2014in search of more favourable conditions. They return the following year, in many cases to the exact location where their journey began. \u2026 We know that some species use the Earth\u2019s magnetic field to navigate with GPS-like precision and others gaze skyward and guide their migration by the stars. We are just now learning that for some animals, the key to a successful migration is all in their heads\u2014complex thought and memory are also necessary for a successful migration. For nearly a decade, we have studied the roles of cognition, learning and memory in the migration of a fairly atypical species\u2014the painted turtle, common to neighbourhood ponds and roadside ditches.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019re not as charismatic as sea turtles, and they sure don\u2019t travel as far \u2026 but what they lack in outward charisma they make up in tenacity. When these turtles take to land each summer, migrating to new habitats when their home ponds dry up, they face seemingly insurmountable odds: scorching heat, dehydration, the crushing tug of gravity, new predatory threats from both land and air, and the ever-present threat of vehicles when crossing a road. <br /><br />Painted turtles at our research site, which is on conservation land within a patchwork of old growth woodlands and agricultural fields, follow long, intricate routes with amazing precision\u2014specific to within a few meters\u2014to far-off, permanent water sources year after year, returning home again when the seasons next change. \u2026 To see just where this incredible migratory behaviour came from, we introduced into our site animals without any experience migrating there and monitored their ability to respond to seasonal changes in their habitats. Naive juveniles under four years old learned to navigate the complex paths just as precisely as experienced local turtles and were able to locate far-off water sources. Naive adults could not. <br /><br />How can a turtle possibly think its way through migration? They do it the same way that we do: they form and remember memories of space and place using the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has long been known to play a role in spatial memory in mammals. To test whether the turtle brain also works this way, we gave freely migrating turtles (both experienced adults and naive juveniles) mind-altering drugs that temporarily block acetylcholine in their brains.<br /><br />While the drugs were active and the turtles were without access to spatial memory, the adults with previous experience in the system wandered aimlessly and were unable to follow their traditional migration routes. As soon as the drugs wore off, they got right back on track and were able to successfully migrate to their winter home. And what about naive juvenile turtles? They were unaffected by the drug; they followed the paths perfectly whether on the drug or not. Why? They had no memory to disrupt! This demonstrates that adults use spatial memory to navigate during migration, and that they form these memories as juveniles prior to the age of four. This type of higher-order cognitive processing during migration has been previously attributed only to birds and mammals.</p>",

    Explanation:
      '</span>\t<span style="font-family: ;">We</span><span style="font-family: ;"> don\u2019t have information in the passage to make the inference that painted turtles don\u2019t use either Earth\u2019s magnetic field or stars to migrate. Option [2] is incorrect because na\u00efve painted turtles migrated even when under the effect of the mind-altering drug that temporarily blocked acetylcholine in their brains. The second part of the passage deals with the migratory pattern of painted turtles. Refer the last paragraph: \u201c\u2026 adults use spatial memory to navigate during migration\u2026 they form these memories as juveniles prior to the age of four. This type of higher-order cognitive processing during migration has been previously attributed only to birds and mammals.\u201d Here,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ;">they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ;">refers</span><span style="font-family: ;"> to painted turtles</span><span style="font-family: ;">.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ;">The importance of a critical learning period is evident in the case of painted turtles; but, we have insufficient data to extend this conclusion to animals in general (as option 4 does). Option 3 is inferable; the passage only conveys that the neurotransmitter helps turtles form and remember memories of space and place thus enabling migration. Nevertheless, what enabled na\u00efve juveniles (who had no memory) to migrate is still unanswered.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ;">Hence, [3].</span>',

      "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 5 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Faced with unfavourable, often seasonal, changes in climate or habitat quality, animals, from birds to butterflies and wildebeests to sea turtles, migrate vast distances\u2014often thousands of miles\u2014in search of more favourable conditions. They return the following year, in many cases to the exact location where their journey began. \u2026 We know that some species use the Earth\u2019s magnetic field to navigate with GPS-like precision and others gaze skyward and guide their migration by the stars. We are just now learning that for some animals, the key to a successful migration is all in their heads\u2014complex thought and memory are also necessary for a successful migration. For nearly a decade, we have studied the roles of cognition, learning and memory in the migration of a fairly atypical species\u2014the painted turtle, common to neighbourhood ponds and roadside ditches.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>They\u2019re not as charismatic as sea turtles, and they sure don\u2019t travel as far \u2026 but what they lack in outward charisma they make up in tenacity. When these turtles take to land each summer, migrating to new habitats when their home ponds dry up, they face seemingly insurmountable odds: scorching heat, dehydration, the crushing tug of gravity, new predatory threats from both land and air, and the ever-present threat of vehicles when crossing a road. <br /><br />Painted turtles at our research site, which is on conservation land within a patchwork of old growth woodlands and agricultural fields, follow long, intricate routes with amazing precision\u2014specific to within a few meters\u2014to far-off, permanent water sources year after year, returning home again when the seasons next change. \u2026 To see just where this incredible migratory behaviour came from, we introduced into our site animals without any experience migrating there and monitored their ability to respond to seasonal changes in their habitats. Naive juveniles under four years old learned to navigate the complex paths just as precisely as experienced local turtles and were able to locate far-off water sources. Naive adults could not. <br /><br />How can a turtle possibly think its way through migration? They do it the same way that we do: they form and remember memories of space and place using the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has long been known to play a role in spatial memory in mammals. To test whether the turtle brain also works this way, we gave freely migrating turtles (both experienced adults and naive juveniles) mind-altering drugs that temporarily block acetylcholine in their brains.<br /><br />While the drugs were active and the turtles were without access to spatial memory, the adults with previous experience in the system wandered aimlessly and were unable to follow their traditional migration routes. As soon as the drugs wore off, they got right back on track and were able to successfully migrate to their winter home. And what about naive juvenile turtles? They were unaffected by the drug; they followed the paths perfectly whether on the drug or not. Why? They had no memory to disrupt! This demonstrates that adults use spatial memory to navigate during migration, and that they form these memories as juveniles prior to the age of four. This type of higher-order cognitive processing during migration has been previously attributed only to birds and mammals.</p>",

      "<p><span>The</span><span> passage talks about two experiments\u2014one that involved na\u00efve adults and another that did not. The one that included na\u00efve adults involved introducing both na\u00efve adults and juveniles to unfamiliar migratory grounds. And the other experiment involved injecting a mind altering drug into</span>freely migrating turtles (both experienced adults and naive juveniles). In the first experiment juveniles, though inexperienced, responded well to migration while na\u00efve adults did not. Refer to the last paragraph: \u201cThey had no memory to disrupt! This demonstrates that adults use spatial memory to navigate during migration, and that they form these memories as juveniles prior to the age of four.\u201d Options 1 and 4 are incorrect as they mix up both experiments.

    Explanation:
      "<p><span>The</span><span> question asks to identify the most pivotal finding that the author discusses. Option 4 is the correct answer since the author is predominantly discussing a new finding that has discovered how warm ocean water is causing weaknesses in the ice sheets, which will result in causing sea levels to rise much sooner than earlier research had predicted (Paragraph 1, sentence 1; Paragraph 2, sentence 1,</span><span>2). Option 1 can be ruled out as it is far more general, and overarching than the most pivotal finding. Option 2 is an outcome based on the finding, and Option 3 is data that supports the research finding.</span> <span>Hence, [4]</span></p>",

    Explanation:
      "<p>Answer Option 3 is not in agreement with the facts outlined in the passage. Option 1 is presented as factual data presented in sentence 1 and 2 of paragraph 2.<span>(The Antarctic lost 40 billion tons of melting ice to the ocean each year from 1979 to 1989.</span><span> That figure rose to 252 billion tons lost\u00a0</span>per year \u2026 the region is losing six times as much ice as it was four decades ago, an unprecedented pace in the era of modern measurements.). Option 2 is supported by paragraph 7, \u201cThe outward ice flow is normal and natural, and it is typically offset by some 2 trillion tons of snowfall atop Antarctica each year, a process that on its own would leave Earth\u2019s sea level relatively unchanged. \u201c Option 4 can be inferred from the last paragraph, \u201cWest Antarctica is the continent\u2019s major ice loser \u2026\u00a0<span>Thwaites</span><span> Glacier, the biggest and potentially most vulnerable in the region, has lost 634 billion\u201d implies that the loss is the highest there. The writer does not attribute the rise in sea levels to human activities directly. It is said that emissions (carbon output) are responsible for the phenomenon. Though he states that \u201cif the world does not sharply decrease its carbon output\u201d sea levels can further increase, he does not attribute the phenomenon itself to human activities. The implication is that it may be accelerated by human activities.\u00a0</span><span>Hence, [3].</span></p>",

    Passage:
      "<p><strong> </strong><strong>The</strong><strong> passage below is accompanied by a set of 4 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />Antarctic glaciers have been melting at an accelerating pace over the past four decades thanks to an influx of warm ocean water \u2014 a startling new finding that researchers say could mean sea levels are poised to rise more quickly than predicted in coming decades.</span><br /><br />The Antarctic lost 40 billion tons of melting ice to the ocean each year from 1979 to 1989.</span> That figure rose to 252 billion tons lost per year beginning in 2009, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. That means the region is losing six times as much ice as it was four decades ago, an unprecedented pace in the era of modern measurements. </span><br /><br />\u201cI don\u2019t want to be alarmist,\u201d said Eric </span>Rignot</span>, an Earth-systems scientist for the University of California at Irvine and NASA who led the work. But he said the weaknesses that researchers have detected in East Antarctica \u2014 home to the largest ice sheet on the planet \u2014 deserve deeper study.</span><br /><br />The places undergoing changes in Antarctica are not limited to just a couple places,\u201d </span>Rignot</span> said. \u201cThey seem to be more extensive than what we thought. That, to me, seems to be reason for concern.\u201d</span><br /><br />The findings are the latest sign that the world could face catastrophic consequences if climate change continues unabated. In addition to more-frequent droughts, heat waves, severe storms and other extreme weather that could come with a continually warming Earth, scientists already have predicted that seas could rise nearly three feet globally by 2100 if the world does not sharply decrease its carbon output. But in recent years, there has been growing concern that the Antarctic could push that even higher.</span><br /><br />That kind of sea-level rise would result in the inundation of island communities around the globe, devastating wildlife habitats and threatening drinking-water supplies. Global sea levels have already risen seven to eight inches since 1900</span>.</span><br /><br />The ice of Antarctica contains 57.2 meters, or 187.66 feet, of potential sea-level rise. This massive body of ice flows out into the ocean through a complex array of partially submerged glaciers and thick floating expanses of ice called ice shelves.</span><br /><br />The outward ice flow is normal and natural, and it is typically offset by some 2 trillion tons of snowfall atop Antarctica each year, a process that on its own would leave Earth\u2019s sea level relatively unchanged. However, if the ice flow speeds up, the ice sheet\u2019s losses can outpace snowfall volume. When that happens, seas rise.</span><br /><br />That\u2019s what the new research says is happening. Scientists came to that conclusion after systematically computing gains and losses across 65 sectors of Antarctica where large glaciers \u2014 or glaciers flowing into an ice shelf \u2014 reach the sea.</span><br /><br />West Antarctica is the continent\u2019s major ice loser. The</span> research affirms that finding, detailing how a single glacier, Pine Island, has lost more than a trillion tons of ice since 1979. </span>Thwaites</span> Glacier, the biggest and potentially most vulnerable in the region, has lost 634 billion. The entire West Antarctic ice sheet is capable of driving a sea-level rise of 5.28 meters, or 17.32 feet, and is now losing 159 billion tons every year.</span></p>",

      "<p>It does not undermine the arguments presented by the author, but instead reinforces the discussion outlined by the author talks about- in stating that internal weaknesses will have consequences on the Antarctic region. <br /><span>Option 1 is incorrect, because, it shows that CO2 emissions have actually declined and still Antarctica continues to lose. This undermines the study which calls for a \u2018sharp reduction in CO2 emissions to address the issue. . Option 3 too would undermine what the author is discussing because if there wasn\u2019t a systematic access to the glaciers, it is not possible for research findings to be credible. Option 4 flouts the findings evidently, by stating that researchers make speculative and exaggerated projections.\u00a0</span> <br /><span>Hence, [2].</span></p>",

They are not alive in the sense that the bacteria in your gut are alive. Rather, dried up and in suspended animation.

Choose the option that best captures the author\u2019s position.</strong><br /><br /><br />As a view within political philosophy, egalitarianism has to do both with how people are treated and with distributive justice. Civil rights movements reject certain types of social and political discrimination and demand that people be treated equally. Distributive justice is another form of egalitarianism that addresses life outcomes and the allocation of valuable things such as income, wealth, and other goods. Is egalitarianism about subjective feelings of well-being, about wealth and income, about a broader conception of resources, or some other alternative? This leads us to the question of whether an equal distribution of the preferred metric deals with the starting gate of each person\u2019s life or with equality of life outcomes.</p>",

The writer also asks whether other metrics like subjective feelings or other broader concepts should be used to understand egalitarianism. The question whether equality is at the initial position or later is also pertinent. The author\u2019s position briefly is that these are contentious issues in understanding what egalitarianism is. \u2018muddled by a lack of consensus\u2019 in option 1, \u2018cannot be resolved\u2019 in option 2, and the lack of mention of the metrics in option 4 eliminate them.</span><span>Hence, [3].</span></p>",

      "<b>The</b><b> passage given below is followed by four summaries. Choose the option that best captures the author\u2019s position.</b><br><br>German sociologist Max Weber contextualised the role of journalism in relation to academic scholarship. He wrote: \u201cNot everyone realizes that to write a really good piece of journalism is at least as demanding intellectually as the achievement of any scholar. This is particularly true when we recollect that it has to be written on the spot, to order, and that it must create an immediate effect, even though it is produced under completely different conditions from that of scholarly research. It is generally overlooked that a journalist\u2019s actual responsibility is far greater than the scholar\u2019s.\u201d While many recognise the act of verification as the central function of journalism, very few recognise journalism\u2019s role of bearing witness to events. It remains the voice of the people.",

    Explanation:
      '</span>\t<span style="font-family: ;">The</span><span style="font-family: ;"> author quotes Max Weber to highlight the difference between journalism and academic scholarship. He concludes, \u201cWhile many recognize the act of verification as the central function of journalism, very few recognize journalism\u2019s role of bearing witness to events. It remains the voice of the people.\u201d So, the author\u2019s purpose is to highlight how journalism is different form academic scholarship. Option 1 best encapsulates the position of the author. Option 2 does not highlight the difference. Option 3 highlights only the responsibility part. Option 4 summarizes Max Weber\u2019s position and not the author\u2019s.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ;">Hence, [1].</span>',

Carnivores are cast in the role of natural enemies of paleontologists.<br />3. Owls and other birds of prey, for example, have kept a long-running record of small mammals in the pellets they deposit.<br />4. The more paleontologists and anthropologists look at the fossil record, the more it\u2019s apparent that meat-eating animals have helped make the fossil record we now study.<br />5.

The 5-1 pair gives us the theme of the paragraph as well: animal agriculture being one of the major sources of greenhouse gases the search for sustainable protein sources will help us reduce humanity\u2019s footprint on our planet. Sentences 2 and 3 are related to this theme \u2013 that food tech entrepreneurs that producing better plant based burgers and some in the meat industry are investing in alt-protein companies.  Sentence 4, however, is a general statement about how new technologies are resisted.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: ;">Hence,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: ;">4</span><span style="font-family: ;">.</span><span style="font-family: ;">&nbsp;</span>',

From one farmer, he purchased 8 kg of rice for a total of Rs. 100, while from the second farmer, he purchased 4 kg of rice for a total of Rs. 120. He had to incur transportation cost to bring the rice to his shop, which was equal to 5% of the amount he paid to the farmers. On reaching his shop, he mixed the rice purchased from the two farmers. While mixing, 2% rice fell on the ground and therefore could not be sold. At what price should he sell the rice so as to make 10% overall profit?</p>",

Autor\u2019s 2015 paper, \u201cWhy Are There Still so Many Jobs?\u201d considers the problem in the context of Polanyi\u2019s Paradox.

The third category involves feeding materials into machine-driven production processes (serving as a human robot) which is followed by actually guiding the operations of a machine (acting as a human microprocessor). In the fifth and sixth categories, one is elevated from microprocessor to software, performing accounting-and-control tasks or facilitating communication and the exchange of information.

    "Explanation": "<p>Option 1 highlights a fact that the author mentions in passing in the fifth paragraph-- that we have now reached a point where robots are better than humans at communication and exchange of information, especially misinformation. The author concedes that we should be worried about it for economic reasons; however, it\u2019s not the overall argument of the author. Option 3 is a distractor. \u2018Many jobs\u2019 in the option is vague \u2013 whether they are middle category jobs or others, cannot be ascertained. \u201c\u2026mandate genuine economic value\u201d is also vague and unrelated to the passage. Option 4 can be considered for the answer. Human labour\u00a0<em>as a whole or completely </em>being rendered superfluous makes the option worthy of evaluation. But, on scrutiny,\u00a0the option\u00a0may be found\u00a0even contrary to the passage, which states that in several categories of human employment (categories 1 to 6), human labour has been rendered superfluous, while option 4\u00a0claims\u00a0that \u201chuman labour being rendered superfluous by automation (is) unsustainable.\u201d Option 2 is correct-- \u201c\u2026robots cannot do what humans cannot tell\u00a0them to do\u201d refers directly to\u00a0Polanyi\u2019s paradox and\u00a0\u2018human connection\u2019 which are the main ideas in the passage.\u00a0Hence, [2].</p>",

Autor\u2019s 2015 paper, \u201cWhy Are There Still so Many Jobs?\u201d considers the problem in the context of Polanyi\u2019s Paradox. Given that \u201cwe can know more than we can tell,\u201d Michael Polanyi observed, we shouldn\u2019t assume that technology can replicate the function of human knowledge itself. <br><br>This distinction between tacit knowledge and information bears directly on the question of what humans will be doing to produce economic value in the future. Historically, the tasks that humans have performed have fallen into ten broad categories. The first is using one\u2019s body to move physical objects, followed by using one\u2019s eyes and fingers to create discrete material goods. The third category involves feeding materials into machine-driven production processes (serving as a human robot) which is followed by actually guiding the operations of a machine (acting as a human microprocessor). In the fifth and sixth categories, one is elevated from microprocessor to software, performing accounting-and-control tasks or facilitating communication and the exchange of information. In the seventh category, one actually writes the software, translating tasks into code. In the eighth category, one provides a human connection, whereas in the ninth, one acts as cheerleader, manager, or arbiter for other humans. Finally, in the tenth category, one thinks critically about complex problems, and then devises novel inventions or solutions. <br><br>For the past 6,000 years, tasks in the first category have been offloaded to animals and to machines. For the past 300 years, tasks in the second category have also been offloaded to machines. In both cases, jobs in categories three through six became far more prevalent, and wages grew enormously.<br><br>But we have since developed machines that are better than humans at performing tasks in categories three and four which is why manufacturing as a share of total employment in advanced economies has been declining for two generations, even as the productivity of manufacturing has increased.

Option 3 is incorrect because the demands of increased productivity were&nbsp;not placed on labour, but on automated processes. Option 4 is incorrect as the passage refers to anti-inflationary policies, it does not talk about inflation per se.&nbsp;Hence, [2].",

    "Passage": "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage be</strong><strong>low is accompanied by a set of </strong><strong>\u00a0questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />In <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>, Milton Friedman accused corporate social responsibility of being a \u2018fundamentally subversive doctrine\u2019. In Friedman\u2019s view, the business of business is business, not political causes, and certainly not progressive ones. However, the view that businesses fulfil a larger social purpose than filling the pockets of shareholders has recently grown more popular than ever.<br /><br />Entrepreneurs, CEOs and business management writers have talked about \u2018creative capitalism\u2019 (Bill Gates), \u2018creating shared value\u2019 (Michael E Porter), \u2018conscious capitalism\u2019 (John Mackey), or \u2018inclusive capitalism\u2019 (C K Prahalad). The common underlying idea is that not all kinds of profit are equally legitimate. For them, \u2018stakeholders\u2019 \u2013 not just shareholders \u2013 should be taken seriously by the corporation. The invocation of responsibility towards stakeholders is one way of claiming the social legitimacy of business corporations, whose social legitimacy and authority historically has been questioned again and again \u2026<br /><br />But many companies often find ways to brand themselves and to market their commitments to social purposes. Today, international organizations including the United Nations have taken over a view of corporations as being institutions that can be channelled in the direction of social purposes. With the launch of the UN Millennium Development Goals in 2000 and subsequently in the Sustainable Development Goals of 2015, the role of business as a key partner in achieving these goals was given much weight. In response to an economic globalisation with weak political international integration, the idea was that businesses should play a vital role for development and poverty-reduction.<br /><br />A more progressive spirit in the world of business wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing. Most people wouldn\u2019t rather live in a world where entrepreneurs couldn\u2019t care less about human welfare. However, it\u2019s unlikely that more substantial and lasting progressive social change will come from a new corporate ethic. While proponents of progressive business often proclaim to be the vanguard of a new \u2018revolution\u2019 wherein the role of business in society as we know it will change, it is worth noting that progressive business is by no means a new idea.<br /><br />For example, the book <em>The</em> <em>American</em> <em>Business</em> <em>Creed</em> came out in 1956. Written by a distinguished team of three economists and one sociologist, it was the most comprehensive account of US business ideology ever written. The book laid bare a conceptual tension between two kinds of business ideologies: \u2018the classical business creed\u2019 and \u2018the managerial business creed\u2019. While the former saw profit-maximisation as the central goal of corporations, the latter saw social responsibility as the key goal. <br /><br />The \u2018classical\u2019 view held sway in the 60\u2019s through the 80\u2019s but \u00a0\u2018managerialism\u2019 with its ethic of business as being socially responsible to multiple stakeholders, remained alive, and since the 1990s, the spirit of progressive business has resurfaced. However, todays\u2019 proponents of progressive business exist in an environment of historic inequality, broken labour unions and a crisis of social democracy.</p>",

It proceeds to talk about the growing reference to the idea of\u2018social responsibility to stakeholders\u2019\u00a0[as much as to shareholders],\u00a0and the efforts by companies to claim commitment to\u00a0this doctrine.\u00a0Though the author believes that \u2018a\u00a0more progressive spirit in the world of business wouldn\u2019t be a\u00a0bad thing\u2019, he asserts in paragraph 4 that\u00a0\u201c\u2026it\u2019s unlikely that more substantial and lasting progressive social change will come from a new corporate ethic.\u201d The\u00a0paragraph\u00a0then goes on to discuss why progressive business as an ideology is not really a \u2018revolution\u2019 as it is an old idea. It ends by stating: \u201cHowever,\u00a0todays\u2019 proponents of progressive business exist in an environment of historic inequality, broken labour unions and a crisis of social democracy.\u201d Thus, the passage is sceptical on the efficacy of the doctrine as\u00a0it\u00a0sees a strictly limited role for\u00a0the same in the current set-up. Only option 3 sums up the passage accurately. Other options\u00a0only\u00a0highlight parts of the passage.\u00a0\u00a0Hence, [3].</p>",

    "Passage": "<p><strong>The</strong><strong> passage be</strong><strong>low is accompanied by a set of </strong><strong>\u00a0questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />In <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>, Milton Friedman accused corporate social responsibility of being a \u2018fundamentally subversive doctrine\u2019. In Friedman\u2019s view, the business of business is business, not political causes, and certainly not progressive ones. However, the view that businesses fulfil a larger social purpose than filling the pockets of shareholders has recently grown more popular than ever.<br /><br />Entrepreneurs, CEOs and business management writers have talked about \u2018creative capitalism\u2019 (Bill Gates), \u2018creating shared value\u2019 (Michael E Porter), \u2018conscious capitalism\u2019 (John Mackey), or \u2018inclusive capitalism\u2019 (C K Prahalad). The common underlying idea is that not all kinds of profit are equally legitimate. For them, \u2018stakeholders\u2019 \u2013 not just shareholders \u2013 should be taken seriously by the corporation. The invocation of responsibility towards stakeholders is one way of claiming the social legitimacy of business corporations, whose social legitimacy and authority historically has been questioned again and again \u2026<br /><br />But many companies often find ways to brand themselves and to market their commitments to social purposes. Today, international organizations including the United Nations have taken over a view of corporations as being institutions that can be channelled in the direction of social purposes. With the launch of the UN Millennium Development Goals in 2000 and subsequently in the Sustainable Development Goals of 2015, the role of business as a key partner in achieving these goals was given much weight. In response to an economic globalisation with weak political international integration, the idea was that businesses should play a vital role for development and poverty-reduction.<br /><br />A more progressive spirit in the world of business wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing. Most people wouldn\u2019t rather live in a world where entrepreneurs couldn\u2019t care less about human welfare. However, it\u2019s unlikely that more substantial and lasting progressive social change will come from a new corporate ethic. While proponents of progressive business often proclaim to be the vanguard of a new \u2018revolution\u2019 wherein the role of business in society as we know it will change, it is worth noting that progressive business is by no means a new idea.<br /><br />For example, the book <em>The</em> <em>American</em> <em>Business</em> <em>Creed</em> came out in 1956. Written by a distinguished team of three economists and one sociologist, it was the most comprehensive account of US business ideology ever written. The book laid bare a conceptual tension between two kinds of business ideologies: \u2018the classical business creed\u2019 and \u2018the managerial business creed\u2019. While the former saw profit-maximisation as the central goal of corporations, the latter saw social responsibility as the key goal. <br /><br />The \u2018classical\u2019 view held sway in the 60\u2019s through the 80\u2019s but \u00a0\u2018managerialism\u2019 with its ethic of business as being socially responsible to multiple stakeholders, remained alive, and since the 1990s, the spirit of progressive business has resurfaced. However, todays\u2019 proponents of progressive business exist in an environment of historic inequality, broken labour unions and a crisis of social democracy.</p>",

    "Explanation": "Refer to the penultimate paragraph: \u201cWhere the former [the classical business creed] saw profit-maximization as the central goal of corporations, the latter [the managerial business creed] saw social responsibility as the key goal.\u201d Thus, social responsibility as opposed to profits is the goal of the&nbsp;\u2018managerial creed of&nbsp;business\u2019. The managerial creed&nbsp;relates to the doctrine of progressive business; as paragraph 2 states: \u201cThe common underlying idea is that not all kinds of profit are equally legitimate\u201d. Options 2 and 4 would apply to the&nbsp;\u2018classical business creed\u2019. Option 3 is incorrect as it is not an outdated concept \u2013 many businesses continue to exist with \u2018managerial\u2019 ideology.&nbsp;Hence, [1].",

With the launch of the UN Millennium Development Goals in 2000 and subsequently in the Sustainable Development Goals of 2015, the role of business as a key partner in achieving these goals was given much weight. In response to an economic globalisation with weak political international integration, the idea was that businesses should play a vital role for development and poverty-reduction.<br /><br />A more progressive spirit in the world of business wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing. Most people wouldn\u2019t rather live in a world where entrepreneurs couldn\u2019t care less about human welfare. However, it\u2019s unlikely that more substantial and lasting progressive social change will come from a new corporate ethic. While proponents of progressive business often proclaim to be the vanguard of a new \u2018revolution\u2019 wherein the role of business in society as we know it will change, it is worth noting that progressive business is by no means a new idea.<br /><br />For example, the book <em>The</em> <em>American</em> <em>Business</em> <em>Creed</em> came out in 1956. Written by a distinguished team of three economists and one sociologist, it was the most comprehensive account of US business ideology ever written. The book laid bare a conceptual tension between two kinds of business ideologies: \u2018the classical business creed\u2019 and \u2018the managerial business creed\u2019. While the former saw profit-maximisation as the central goal of corporations, the latter saw social responsibility as the key goal. <br /><br />The \u2018classical\u2019 view held sway in the 60\u2019s through the 80\u2019s but \u00a0\u2018managerialism\u2019 with its ethic of business as being socially responsible to multiple stakeholders, remained alive, and since the 1990s, the spirit of progressive business has resurfaced. However, todays\u2019 proponents of progressive business exist in an environment of historic inequality, broken labour unions and a crisis of social democracy.</p>",

Choose the best answer for each question.</strong><br /><br />In <em>Capitalism and Freedom</em>, Milton Friedman accused corporate social responsibility of being a \u2018fundamentally subversive doctrine\u2019. In Friedman\u2019s view, the business of business is business, not political causes, and certainly not progressive ones. However, the view that businesses fulfil a larger social purpose than filling the pockets of shareholders has recently grown more popular than ever.<br /><br />Entrepreneurs, CEOs and business management writers have talked about \u2018creative capitalism\u2019 (Bill Gates), \u2018creating shared value\u2019 (Michael E Porter), \u2018conscious capitalism\u2019 (John Mackey), or \u2018inclusive capitalism\u2019 (C K Prahalad). The common underlying idea is that not all kinds of profit are equally legitimate. For them, \u2018stakeholders\u2019 \u2013 not just shareholders \u2013 should be taken seriously by the corporation. The invocation of responsibility towards stakeholders is one way of claiming the social legitimacy of business corporations, whose social legitimacy and authority historically has been questioned again and again \u2026<br /><br />But many companies often find ways to brand themselves and to market their commitments to social purposes.

While proponents of progressive business often proclaim to be the vanguard of a new \u2018revolution\u2019 wherein the role of business in society as we know it will change, it is worth noting that progressive business is by no means a new idea.\u201d By suggesting that it\u2019s an old idea, the authorundermines the \u201crevolutionary\u201d\u00a0aspect.He also\u00a0implies that it\u00a0has never been able to get ahead of the \u2018classical ideology\u2019;\u00a0use of the word \u2018resurfaced\u2019 in the last paragraph also\u00a0points to this. The reference to the changed scenario with greater challenges of \u201cinequality, broken trade unions etc.,\u201d suggests that author indicates that the idea is unlikely to succeed.\u00a0Hence, option\u00a03\u00a0is correct. Option 1 is not stated or implied by the writer.

Choose the best answer for each question.</strong></span><br /><br /><span>Today, it feels as if our privacy is under attack like never before. Governments and private corporations alike seem to be able to learn whatever they want to about us from the data they collect in the course of our interactions. The sophisticated algorithms they run are able to infer more about who we are than we can. It feels like the walls we built to protect our personal space are slowly but surely being torn down by digital businesses that know more about us than we do ourselves.</span><br /><br /><span>Every business, no matter how big or small, understands the value of data today. Firms recognize the benefits that can be gained from leveraging personal data and are eager to exploit it in order to provide various innovative services that their increasingly mobile customers have begun to demand. If they did not initially understand the impact that this pivot towards data would have on the personal privacy of their customers, given the heightened sensitivity to issues relating to privacy, they are now alive to its many consequences. Why then do they still look to develop newer and more complex data-driven businesses despite the privacy risks posed by it?</span><br /><br />In order to understand why this is happening, we need to examine these developments in the context of the economic foundations on which our modern notion of personal privacy is based. Since privacy is fundamentally a capitalist construct, its continued existence as a right worth fighting for depends on the forces of wealth control remaining aligned in favour of ensuring its preservation. So long as it is in our economic interests to continue to protect privacy, we will do so, but the moment that changes, any expectation that we might currently have of being able to continue to exercise our right to privacy comes under threat.<br /><br /><span>In the past, wealth was used to preserve personal privacy. Today, it is impossible to remain profitable if your business does not do what is needed to incorporate data into the core of your offering. If you do not embrace this new reality, your competitors will, regardless of the privacy consequences of doing so. It is rapidly becoming clear that capitalist interests are no longer aligned with protecting personal privacy. To the contrary, it is in the commercial interests of modern businesses to wring as much out of the personal data of their customers as is commercially feasible.</span><br /><br /><span>It is precisely because of the capitalist origins of our notion of privacy that there is such an indifference towards privacy concerns. If we think there is a benefit to preserving personal privacy and want to encourage behaviour that preserves privacy, we will need to find commercial disincentives that outweigh the financial benefits.</span></p>",

The management scholar Emilio Castilla at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the sociologist Stephen Benard at Indiana University studied attempts to implement meritocratic practices, such as performance-based compensation in private companies.

While this effect is most spectacular among the elite, nearly any accomplishment can be viewed through meritocratic eyes.

That is why, under the assumption of meritocracy, the very notion that personal success is the result of \u2018luck\u2019 can be insulting.

    "Explanation": "<p>Option 3. The first sentence of the passage states what is paradoxical about meritocracy. The second paragraph states that \u201cthis \u2018paradox of meritocracy\u2019 occurs because explicitly adopting meritocracy as a value convinces subjects of their own moral bona fides.\u201d The paradox is explainedin the first and the second paragraphs. In companies with meritocracy as a stated principle, women employees were discriminated against,thus\u00a0displaying a gender bias;this is despite the fact that impartiality\u00a0comes at the core of meritocracy.\u00a0In other words,\u00a0\u201c\u2026meritocracy leads to just the kinds of inequalities that it aims to eliminate.\u201d\u00a0In the following part, this paradox is\u00a0explained to be a result of theself-righteousness and narrow mindedness\u00a0that is fed by a\u00a0belief in meritocracy (they become less inclined to examine their own prejudices). Option 3 best expresses this idea. Option 1 does not explain the paradox of meritocracy; it\u00a0only\u00a0echoes\u00a0the stated aim of meritocracy.\u00a0Option 2, similarly, states another aspect of meritocracy and does not constitute a paradox. Option 4 repeats the idea in option 2 without referring to the paradox. Hence, [3]</p>",

Option 1 is contrary to the passage, the students rationalize unfair social inequalities (the option states \u2018practices\u2019 which has different implications) by NOT attributing them to external factors. Eliminate option 1.\u00a0Option 2 is incorrect because \u2018even playing field\u2019 means meritocracy; to say that they no longer believe in\u00a0the \u2018even playing field\u2019 is, hence, incorrect. Option 3 is not stated or implied in the passage; there is no implication of an \u2018exaggerated confidence in their own talent\u2019 or\u00a0\u2018their inability to accept failures\u2019.

    "Passage": "<p><span style=\"color: #auto;\"><strong>The passage below is accompanied by a set of\u00a0 questions. Choose the best answer for each question.</strong></span><br /><br />Holding meritocracy as a value seems to promote discriminatory behaviour. The management scholar Emilio Castilla at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the sociologist Stephen Benard at Indiana University studied attempts to implement meritocratic practices, such as performance-based compensation in private companies. They found that, in companies that explicitly held meritocracy as a core value, managers assigned greater rewards to male employees over female employees with identical performance evaluations. This preference disappeared where meritocracy was not explicitly adopted as a value.<br /><br />This is surprising because impartiality is the core of meritocracy\u2019s moral appeal. The \u2018even playing field\u2019 is intended to avoid unfair inequalities based on gender, race and the like. Yet Castilla and Benard found that, ironically, attempts to implement meritocracy leads to just the kinds of inequalities that it aims to eliminate. They suggest that this \u2018paradox of meritocracy\u2019 occurs because explicitly adopting meritocracy as a value convinces subjects of their own moral bona fides. Satisfied that they are just, they become less inclined to examine their own behaviour for signs of prejudice.<br /><br />Meritocracy is a false and not very salutary belief. As with any ideology, part of its draw is that it justifies the status quo, explaining why people belong where they happen to be in the social order. It is a well-established psychological principle that people prefer to believe that the world is just.<br /><br />However, in addition to legitimation, meritocracy also offers flattery. Where success is determined by merit, each win can be viewed as a reflection of one\u2019s own virtue and worth. Meritocracy is the most self-congratulatory of distribution principles. Its ideological alchemy transmutes property into praise, material inequality into personal superiority. It licenses the rich and powerful to view themselves as productive geniuses. While this effect is most spectacular among the elite, nearly any accomplishment can be viewed through meritocratic eyes. Graduating from high school, artistic success or simply having money can all be seen as evidence of talent and effort. By the same token, worldly failures become signs of personal defects, providing a reason why those at the bottom of the social hierarchy deserve to remain there.<br /><br />This is why debates over the extent to which particular individuals are \u2018self-made\u2019 and over the effects of various forms of \u2018privilege\u2019 can get so hot-tempered. These arguments are not just about who gets to have what; it\u2019s about how much \u2018credit\u2019 people can take for what they have, about what their successes allow them to believe about their inner qualities. That is why, under the assumption of meritocracy, the very notion that personal success is the result of \u2018luck\u2019 can be insulting. To acknowledge the influence of external factors seems to downplay or deny the existence of individual merit. Despite the moral assurance and personal flattery that meritocracy offers to the successful, it ought to be abandoned both as a belief about how the world works and as a general social ideal.</p>",

    "Explanation": "<p>Answer: Option 4. Option 1 is part of the passage [Paragraph 5]. It does not capture the main points in the passage. Besides, \u2018success and wealth as not the result of external factors\u2019 is an understatement of the central idea of the passage. The passage emphasizes meritocracy as a value that reinforces the \u2018moral bona fides\u2019 of the believer. Eliminate option 1. Option 2 is close to the correct answer. However, the last part of the paragraph where the author exhorts that \u201cit (meritocracy) ought to be abandoned both as a belief about how the world works and as a general social ideal\u201d makes meritocracy a false ideal. Option 2 does not take account of this point of view of the author, but merely summarizes the argument that the author has used to convey the message. Option 4, in addition to what is stated in option 2, includes this message of the author and also the indifference that meritocracy brings about towards social inequalities that are invoked at several points in the passage. Hence, option 4 is more comprehensive than option 2. Option 3 is incorrect; the statement is in favour of \u2018meritocracy\u2019, and therefore contradicts the author\u2019s argument against meritocracy. Option 4 accurately states the central idea of the passage. Hence [4]\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

The \u201ctidal wave of comments from the fandom social media\u201d in sentence 4 proves that \u2018fans are thrilled that Mattel made dolls of the global K-Pop band\u2019. Hence, 41 is a better combination than 42. Sentence 2 can be placed after 4-1, because it still talks about the reaction to the toys and introduces a contrasting idea. It begins with \u2018but\u2019 and goes on to state that people are also 'quick to sound off'. Since \u2018sound off\u2019 implies a not so favourable reaction, sentence 3 follows logically withthe phrase, \u2018might even be creepy\u2019.\u00a0Hence, 4123.</p>",

Writers slowly increased his powers over time until, by the Silver Age, he was effectively omnipotent. However, it became increasingly difficult to write stories in which such a hero was believably challenged. A series of attempts to reel in the character were made, which established several hard limits on his abilities (for instance, surviving a nuclear blast nearly exceeded his invulnerability, and his flights into space were limited by how long he could hold his breath).<br /><br />1] With his superhuman strength and intelligence, Superman won the hearts of the young and the old. His stories of bravery continue to be popular through decades.<br />2] Writers soon found that Superman\u2019s increasing powers made their story-writing task very difficult indeed. Hence, the superhero\u2019s strength and abilities became subjected to certain conditions.<br />3] Superman is the most powerful comic hero, and his popularity increased after his comics were made into movies. His fans enjoyed watching their superhero perform unbelievable tasks.<br />4] Superman\u2019s strength has steadily increased since his first comic was published. Today he can lift cars with ease, run at amazing speeds, fly into space as well as survive nuclear blasts. <br /><br />[quizky-text]</p>",

The table given below lists each pair of towns between which the taxis operate and the distance between them. All the passengers take only those routes for travelling where they don't have to change the taxi more than once to reach their destination. The cost of travelling between two towns depends on three factors \u2013 boarding town, the kind of taxi (Standard or Prime) and the distance between the two towns. The fare of Prime taxi is $20/km if starting from A, C or F, and $25/km if starting from B, D or E. The fare of Standard taxi is $12/km if starting from B or E, and $15/km if starting from A, F, C or D.</p><p><br /><img style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" src=\"http://imsclick2cert.blob.core.windows.net/imsitemimages/docximg_1337583666_image1.gif\" alt=\"\" data-docx-image=\"image1.gif\" /></p>",
